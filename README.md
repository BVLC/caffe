This branch of Caffe extends [BVLC-led Caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe) by adding Windows support and other functionalities commonly used by Microsoft's researchers, such as managed-code wrapper, [Faster-RCNN](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5638-faster-r-cnn-towards-real-time-object-detection-with-region-proposal-networks.pdf), [R-FCN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.06409v2.pdf), etc.

Caffe is a deep learning framework made with expression, speed, and modularity in mind.
It is developed by the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center ([BVLC](http://bvlc.eecs.berkeley.edu)) and community contributors.

Check out the [project site](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org) for all the details like

and step-by-step examples.

## Windows Setup
**Requirements**: Visual Studio 2013

### Pre-Build Steps
Copy `.\windows\CommonSettings.props.example` to `.\windows\CommonSettings.props`

By defaults Windows build requires `CUDA` and `cuDNN` libraries.
Both can be disabled by adjusting build variables in `.\windows\CommonSettings.props`.
Python support is disabled by default, but can be enabled via `.\windows\CommonSettings.props` as well.
3rd party dependencies required by Caffe are automatically resolved via NuGet.

### CUDA
Download `CUDA Toolkit 7.5` [from nVidia website](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit).
If you don't have CUDA installed, you can experiment with CPU_ONLY build.
In `.\windows\CommonSettings.props` set `CpuOnlyBuild` to `true` and set `UseCuDNN` to `false`.

### cuDNN
Download `cuDNN v4` or `cuDNN v5` [from nVidia website](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn).
Unpack downloaded zip to %CUDA_PATH% (environment variable set by CUDA installer).
Alternatively, you can unpack zip to any location and set `CuDnnPath` to point to this location in `.\windows\CommonSettings.props`.
`CuDnnPath` defined in `.\windows\CommonSettings.props`.
Also, you can disable cuDNN by setting `UseCuDNN` to `false` in the property file.

### Python
To build Caffe Python wrapper set `PythonSupport` to `true` in `.\windows\CommonSettings.props`.
Download Miniconda 2.7 64-bit Windows installer [from Miniconda website] (http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html).
Install for all users and add Python to PATH (through installer).

Run the following commands from elevated command prompt:

```
conda install --yes numpy scipy matplotlib scikit-image pip
pip install protobuf
```

#### Remark
After you have built solution with Python support, in order to use it you have to either:  
* set `PythonPath` environment variable to point to `<caffe_root>\Build\x64\Release\pycaffe`, or
* copy folder `<caffe_root>\Build\x64\Release\pycaffe\caffe` under `<python_root>\lib\site-packages`.

### Matlab
To build Caffe Matlab wrapper set `MatlabSupport` to `true` and `MatlabDir` to the root of your Matlab installation in `.\windows\CommonSettings.props`.

#### Remark
After you have built solution with Matlab support, in order to use it you have to:
* add the generated `matcaffe` folder to Matlab search path, and
* add `<caffe_root>\Build\x64\Release` to your system path.

### Build
Now, you should be able to build `.\windows\Caffe.sln`
