    "\n",
    "The advantage of this approach is that, since pre-trained networks are learned on a large set of images, the intermediate layers capture the \"semantics\" of the general visual appearance. Think of it as a very powerful generic visual feature that you can treat as a black box. On top of that, only a relatively small amount of data is needed for good performance on the target task."
