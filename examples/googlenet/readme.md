Training GoogLeNet with caffe 
=============================

This is an implementation of the "GoogLeNet" network as devised by Szegedy at al. in their paper ["Going Deeper with Convolutions"](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.4842v1)

We will assum that you have successfully followed the all the data preparation steps under the "imagenet" example to prepare the lmdbs and mean file.

Notice: The solver definition is a default one and did not go under any optimization.
