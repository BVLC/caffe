title: Deep Learning Framework

# Caffe

Caffe is a deep learning framework developed with cleanliness, readability, and speed in mind.
It was created by [Yangqing Jia](http://daggerfs.com) during his PhD at UC Berkeley, and is in active development by the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center ([BVLC](http://bvlc.eecs.berkeley.edu)) and by community contributors.
Caffe is released under the [BSD 2-Clause license](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/blob/master/LICENSE).

Check out our web image classification [demo](http://demo.caffe.berkeleyvision.org)!

## Why use Caffe?

**Clean architecture** enables rapid deployment.
Networks are specified in simple config files, with no hard-coded parameters in the code.
Switching between CPU and GPU is as simple as setting a flag -- so models can be trained on a GPU machine, and then used on commodity clusters.

**Readable & modifiable implementation** fosters active development.
In Caffe's first six months, it has been forked by over 300 developers on Github, and many have pushed significant changes.

**Speed** makes Caffe perfect for industry use.
Caffe can process over **40M images per day** with a single NVIDIA K40 or Titan GPU\*.
That's 5 ms/image in training, and 2 ms/image in test.
We believe that Caffe is the fastest CNN implementation available.

**Community**: Caffe already powers academic research projects, startup prototypes, and even large-scale industrial applications in vision, speech, and multimedia.
There is an active discussion and support community on [Github](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/issues).
