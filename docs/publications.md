# Publications

Caffe powers on-going research projects, large-scale industrial applications, and startup prototypes in vision, speech, and multimedia. Here we highlight publications involving Caffe.

[Caffe: Convolutional Architecture for Fast Feature Embedding](https://github.com/UCB-ICSI-Vision-Group/caffe-paper/raw/arxiv/caffe.pdf): the Caffe tech report on arXiv as submitted to the ACM-MM OSS competition for open-source projects. This introduces the framework and its purpose, compares it to contemporary packages, describes implementation details, and highlights applications.

Please add your own publications by submitting a pull request to the [project github](http://github.com/BVLC/caffe). Send your pull request to the master branch for inclusion on the site and in the documentation.

*Publication list coming soon.*
