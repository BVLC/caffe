title: Solver / Model Optimization

# Solver

The solver orchestrates model optimization by coordinating the network's forward inference and backward gradients to form parameter updates that attempt to improve the loss.
The responsibilities of learning are divided between the Solver for overseeing the optimization and generating parameter updates and the Net for yielding loss and gradients.

The Caffe solvers are:

- Stochastic Gradient Descent (`SGD`), 
- AdaDelta (`ADADELTA`),
- Adaptive Gradient (`ADAGRAD`),
- Adam (`ADAM`),
- Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient (`NESTEROV`) and
- RMSprop (`RMSPROP`)

The solver

1. scaffolds the optimization bookkeeping and creates the training network for learning and test network(s) for evaluation.
2. iteratively optimizes by calling forward / backward and updating parameters
3. (periodically) evaluates the test networks
4. snapshots the model and solver state throughout the optimization

where each iteration

1. calls network forward to compute the output and loss
2. calls network backward to compute the gradients
3. incorporates the gradients into parameter updates according to the solver method
4. updates the solver state according to learning rate, history, and method

to take the weights all the way from initialization to learned model.

Like Caffe models, Caffe solvers run in CPU / GPU modes.

## Methods

The solver methods address the general optimization problem of loss minimization.
For dataset $$D$$, the optimization objective is the average loss over all $$|D|$$ data instances throughout the dataset

$$L(W) = \frac{1}{|D|} \sum_i^{|D|} f_W\left(X^{(i)}\right) + \lambda r(W)$$

where $$f_W\left(X^{(i)}\right)$$ is the loss on data instance $$X^{(i)}$$ and $$r(W)$$ is a regularization term with weight $$\lambda$$.
$$|D|$$ can be very large, so in practice, in each solver iteration we use a stochastic approximation of this objective, drawing a mini-batch of $$N << |D|$$ instances:

$$L(W) \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum_i^N f_W\left(X^{(i)}\right) + \lambda r(W)$$

The model computes $$f_W$$ in the forward pass and the gradient $$\nabla f_W$$ in the backward pass.

The parameter update $$\Delta W$$ is formed by the solver from the error gradient $$\nabla f_W$$, the regularization gradient $$\nabla r(W)$$, and other particulars to each method.

### SGD

**Stochastic gradient descent** (`solver_type: SGD`) updates the weights $$ W $$ by a linear combination of the negative gradient $$ \nabla L(W) $$ and the previous weight update $$ V_t $$.
The **learning rate** $$ \alpha $$ is the weight of the negative gradient.
The **momentum** $$ \mu $$ is the weight of the previous update.

Formally, we have the following formulas to compute the update value $$ V_{t+1} $$ and the updated weights $$ W_{t+1} $$ at iteration $$ t+1 $$, given the previous weight update $$ V_t $$ and current weights $$ W_t $$:

$$
V_{t+1} = \mu V_t - \alpha \nabla L(W_t)
$$

$$
W_{t+1} = W_t + V_{t+1}
$$

The learning "hyperparameters" ($$\alpha$$ and $$\mu$$) might require a bit of tuning for best results.
If you're not sure where to start, take a look at the "Rules of thumb" below, and for further information you might refer to Leon Bottou's [Stochastic Gradient Descent Tricks](http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/192769/tricks-2012.pdf) [1].

#### Rules of thumb for setting the learning rate $$ \alpha $$ and momentum $$ \mu $$

A good strategy for deep learning with SGD is to initialize the learning rate $$ \alpha $$ to a value around $$ \alpha \approx 0.01 = 10^{-2} $$, and dropping it by a constant factor (e.g., 10) throughout training when the loss begins to reach an apparent "plateau", repeating this several times.
Generally, you probably want to use a momentum $$ \mu = 0.9 $$ or similar value.
By smoothing the weight updates across iterations, momentum tends to make deep learning with SGD both stabler and faster.

This was the strategy used by Krizhevsky et al. [1] in their famously winning CNN entry to the ILSVRC-2012 competition, and Caffe makes this strategy easy to implement in a `SolverParameter`, as in our reproduction of [1] at `./examples/imagenet/alexnet_solver.prototxt`.

To use a learning rate policy like this, you can put the following lines somewhere in your solver prototxt file:

    base_lr: 0.01     # begin training at a learning rate of 0.01 = 1e-2

    lr_policy: "step" # learning rate policy: drop the learning rate in "steps"
                      # by a factor of gamma every stepsize iterations

    gamma: 0.1        # drop the learning rate by a factor of 10
                      # (i.e., multiply it by a factor of gamma = 0.1)

    stepsize: 100000  # drop the learning rate every 100K iterations

    max_iter: 350000  # train for 350K iterations total

    momentum: 0.9

Under the above settings, we'll always use `momentum` $$ \mu = 0.9 $$.
We'll begin training at a `base_lr` of $$ \alpha = 0.01 = 10^{-2} $$ for the first 100,000 iterations, then multiply the learning rate by `gamma` ($$ \gamma $$) and train at $$ \alpha' = \alpha \gamma = (0.01) (0.1) = 0.001 = 10^{-3} $$ for iterations 100K-200K, then at $$ \alpha'' = 10^{-4} $$ for iterations 200K-300K, and finally train until iteration 350K (since we have `max_iter: 350000`) at $$ \alpha''' = 10^{-5} $$.

Note that the momentum setting $$ \mu $$ effectively multiplies the size of your updates by a factor of $$ \frac{1}{1 - \mu} $$ after many iterations of training, so if you increase $$ \mu $$, it may be a good idea to **decrease** $$ \alpha $$ accordingly (and vice versa).

For example, with $$ \mu = 0.9 $$, we have an effective update size multiplier of $$ \frac{1}{1 - 0.9} = 10 $$.
If we increased the momentum to $$ \mu = 0.99 $$, we've increased our update size multiplier to 100, so we should drop $$ \alpha $$ (`base_lr`) by a factor of 10.

Note also that the above settings are merely guidelines, and they're definitely not guaranteed to be optimal (or even work at all!) in every situation.
If learning diverges (e.g., you start to see very large or `NaN` or `inf` loss values or outputs), try dropping the `base_lr` (e.g., `base_lr: 0.001`) and re-training, repeating this until you find a `base_lr` value that works.

### AdaDelta

The **AdaDelta** (`solver_type: ADADELTA`) method (M. Zeiler [1]) is a "robust learning rate method". It is a gradient-based optimization method (like SGD). The update formulas are

$$
\begin{align}
(v_t)_i &= \frac{\operatorname{RMS}((v_{t-1})_i)}{\operatorname{RMS}\left( \nabla L(W_t) \right)_{i}} \left( \nabla L(W_{t'}) \right)_i
\\
\operatorname{RMS}\left( \nabla L(W_t) \right)_{i} &= \sqrt{E[g^2] + \varepsilon}
\\
E[g^2]_t &= \delta{E[g^2]_{t-1} } + (1-\delta)g_{t}^2
\end{align}
$$

and 

$$
(W_{t+1})_i =
(W_t)_i - \alpha
(v_t)_i.
$$

### AdaGrad

The **adaptive gradient** (`solver_type: ADAGRAD`) method (Duchi et al. [1]) is a gradient-based optimization method (like SGD) that attempts to "find needles in haystacks in the form of very predictive but rarely seen features," in Duchi et al.'s words.
Given the update information from all previous iterations $$ \left( \nabla L(W) \right)_{t'} $$ for $$ t' \in \{1, 2, ..., t\} $$,
the update formulas proposed by [1] are as follows, specified for each component $$i$$ of the weights $$W$$:

$$
(W_{t+1})_i =
(W_t)_i - \alpha
\frac{\left( \nabla L(W_t) \right)_{i}}{
    \sqrt{\sum_{t'=1}^{t} \left( \nabla L(W_{t'}) \right)_i^2}
}
$$

Note that in practice, for weights $$ W \in \mathcal{R}^d $$, AdaGrad implementations (including the one in Caffe) use only $$ \mathcal{O}(d) $$ extra storage for the historical gradient information (rather than the $$ \mathcal{O}(dt) $$ storage that would be necessary to store each historical gradient individually).

    [Adaptive Subgradient Methods for Online Learning and Stochastic Optimization](http://www.magicbroom.info/Papers/DuchiHaSi10.pdf).
    *The Journal of Machine Learning Research*, 2011.

### Adam

The **Adam** (`solver_type: ADAM`), proposed in Kingma et al. [1], is a gradient-based optimization method (like SGD). This includes an "adaptive moment estimation" ($$m_t, v_t$$) and can be regarded as a generalization of AdaGrad. The update formulas are

$$
(m_t)_i = \beta_1 (m_{t-1})_i + (1-\beta_1)(\nabla L(W_t))_i,\\
(v_t)_i = \beta_2 (v_{t-1})_i + (1-\beta_2)(\nabla L(W_t))_i^2
$$

and

$$
(W_{t+1})_i =
(W_t)_i - \alpha \frac{\sqrt{1-(\beta_2)_i^t}}{1-(\beta_1)_i^t}\frac{(m_t)_i}{\sqrt{(v_t)_i}+\varepsilon}.
$$

Kingma et al. [1] proposed to use $$\beta_1 = 0.9, \beta_2 = 0.999, \varepsilon = 10^{-8}$$ as default values. Caffe uses the values of `momemtum, momentum2, delta` for $$\beta_1, \beta_2, \varepsilon$$, respectively.

### NAG

**Nesterov's accelerated gradient** (`solver_type: NESTEROV`) was proposed by Nesterov [1] as an "optimal" method of convex optimization, achieving a convergence rate of $$ \mathcal{O}(1/t^2) $$ rather than the $$ \mathcal{O}(1/t) $$.
Though the required assumptions to achieve the $$ \mathcal{O}(1/t^2) $$ convergence typically will not hold for deep networks trained with Caffe (e.g., due to non-smoothness and non-convexity), in practice NAG can be a very effective method for optimizing certain types of deep learning architectures, as demonstrated for deep MNIST autoencoders by Sutskever et al. [2].

The weight update formulas look very similar to the SGD updates given above:

$$
V_{t+1} = \mu V_t - \alpha \nabla L(W_t + \mu V_t)
$$

$$
W_{t+1} = W_t + V_{t+1}
$$

What distinguishes the method from SGD is the weight setting $$ W $$ on which we compute the error gradient $$ \nabla L(W) $$ -- in NAG we take the gradient on weights with added momentum $$ \nabla L(W_t + \mu V_t) $$; in SGD we simply take the gradient $$ \nabla L(W_t) $$ on the current weights themselves.

### RMSprop

The **RMSprop** (`solver_type: RMSPROP`), suggested by Tieleman in a Coursera course lecture, is a gradient-based optimization method (like SGD). The update formulas are

$$
(v_t)_i = 
\begin{cases}
(v_{t-1})_i + \delta, &(\nabla L(W_t))_i(\nabla L(W_{t-1}))_i > 0\\
(v_{t-1})_i \cdot (1-\delta), & \text{else}
\end{cases}
$$

$$
(W_{t+1})_i =(W_t)_i - \alpha (v_t)_i,
$$

If the gradient updates results in oscillations the gradient is reduced by times $$1-\delta$$. Otherwise it will be increased by $$\delta$$. The default value of $$\delta$$ (`rms_decay`) is set to $$\delta = 0.02$$.

## Updating Parameters

The actual weight update is made by the solver then applied to the net parameters in `Solver::ComputeUpdateValue()`.
The `ComputeUpdateValue` method incorporates any weight decay $$ r(W) $$ into the weight gradients (which currently just contain the error gradients) to get the final gradient with respect to each network weight.
Then these gradients are scaled by the learning rate $$ \alpha $$ and the update to subtract is stored in each parameter Blob's `diff` field.
Finally, the `Blob::Update` method is called on each parameter blob, which performs the final update (subtracting the Blob's `diff` from its `data`).

## Snapshotting and Resuming

The solver snapshots the weights and its own state during training in `Solver::Snapshot()` and `Solver::SnapshotSolverState()`.
The weight snapshots export the learned model while the solver snapshots allow training to be resumed from a given point.
Training is resumed by `Solver::Restore()` and `Solver::RestoreSolverState()`.

Weights are saved without extension while solver states are saved with `.solverstate` extension.
Both files will have an `_iter_N` suffix for the snapshot iteration number.

Snapshotting is configured by:

    # The snapshot interval in iterations.
    snapshot: 5000
    # File path prefix for snapshotting model weights and solver state.
    # Note: this is relative to the invocation of the `caffe` utility, not the
    # solver definition file.
    snapshot_prefix: "/path/to/model"
    # Snapshot the diff along with the weights. This can help debugging training
    # but takes more storage.
    snapshot_diff: false
    # A final snapshot is saved at the end of training unless
    # this flag is set to false. The default is true.
    snapshot_after_train: true

in the solver definition prototxt.
