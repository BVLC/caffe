      <h1 id="pre-trained-models">Pre-trained models</h1>

<p><a href="http://bvlc.eecs.berkeley.edu">BVLC</a> aims to provide a variety of high quality pre-trained models.
Note that unlike Caffe itself, these models are licensed for <strong>academic research / non-commercial use only</strong>.
If you have any questions, please get in touch with us.</p>

<p><em>UPDATE</em> July 2014: we are actively working on a service for hosting user-uploaded model definition and trained weight files.
Soon, the community will be able to easily contribute different architectures!</p>

<h3 id="imagenet">ImageNet</h3>

<p><strong>Caffe Reference ImageNet Model</strong>: Our reference implementation of an ImageNet model trained on ILSVRC-2012 can be downloaded (232.6MB) by running <code>examples/imagenet/get_caffe_reference_imagenet_model.sh</code> from the Caffe root directory.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The bundled model is the iteration 310,000 snapshot.</li>
  <li>The best validation performance during training was iteration 313,000 with
validation accuracy 57.412% and loss 1.82328.</li>
  <li>This model obtains a top-1 accuracy 57.4% and a top-5 accuracy 80.4% on the validation set, using just the center crop. (Using the average of 10 crops, (4 + 1 center) * 2 mirror, should obtain a bit higher accuracy)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>AlexNet</strong>: Our training of the Krizhevsky architecture, which differs from the paper’s methodology by (1) not training with the relighting data-augmentation and (2) initializing non-zero biases to 0.1 instead of 1. (2) was found necessary for training, as initialization to 1 gave flat loss. Download the model (243.9MB) by running <code>examples/imagenet/get_caffe_alexnet_model.sh</code> from the Caffe root directory.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The bundled model is the iteration 360,000 snapshot.</li>
  <li>The best validation performance during training was iteration 358,000 with
validation accuracy 57.258% and loss 1.83948.</li>
  <li>This model obtains a top-1 accuracy 57.1% and a top-5 accuracy 80.2% on the validation set, using just the center crop. (Using the average of 10 crops, (4 + 1 center) * 2 mirror, should obtain a bit higher accuracy)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>R-CNN (ILSVRC13)</strong>: The pure Caffe instantiation of the <a href="https://github.com/rbgirshick/rcnn">R-CNN</a> model for ILSVRC13 detection. Download the model (230.8MB) by running <code>examples/imagenet/get_caffe_rcnn_imagenet_model.sh</code> from the Caffe root directory. This model was made by transplanting the R-CNN SVM classifiers into a <code>fc-rcnn</code> classification layer, provided here as an off-the-shelf Caffe detector. Try the <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/BVLC/caffe/blob/master/examples/detection.ipynb">detection example</a> to see it in action. For the full details, refer to the R-CNN site. <em>N.B. For research purposes, make use of the official R-CNN package and not this example.</em></p>

<h3 id="auxiliary-data">Auxiliary Data</h3>

<p>Additionally, you will probably eventually need some auxiliary data (mean image, synset list, etc.): run <code>data/ilsvrc12/get_ilsvrc_aux.sh</code> from the root directory to obtain it.</p>
