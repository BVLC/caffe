list of the issues blocking the merge of the DenseNet feature branch:

- critical
-- replacement of GPL'd code (including removal from history)
-- update build process / Makefile to match current practice 
-- tests
-- trivial: remove DenseNet README.md header
-- trivial: remove this todo file

- unclear neccessity, semantics, and/or priority
-- general cleanup of commit sequence (probably mostly squashing)
-- input interface changes (i.e. jpeg filname as input -> ?)
-- output interface changes (?, but probably something: image support size, multiple layer output, alignment, etc.)
-- if still reading image files after any iface changes and removal of GPL code, use XX instead of YY
