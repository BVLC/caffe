---

The pure Caffe instantiation of the [R-CNN](https://github.com/rbgirshick/rcnn) model for ILSVRC13 detection.
This model was made by transplanting the R-CNN SVM classifiers into a `fc-rcnn` classification layer, provided here as an off-the-shelf Caffe detector.
Try the [detection example](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/BVLC/caffe/blob/master/examples/detection.ipynb) to see it in action.

*N.B. For research purposes, make use of the official R-CNN package and not this example.*

This model was trained by Ross Girshick @rbgirshick
