Efficient Graph-Based Image Segmentation

The program takes a color image (PPM format) and produces a segmentation
with a random color assigned to each region.

1) Type "make" to compile "segment".

2) Run "segment sigma k min input output".

The parameters are: (see the paper for details)

sigma: Used to smooth the input image before segmenting it.
k: Value for the threshold function.
min: Minimum component size enforced by post-processing.
input: Input image.
output: Output image.

Typical parameters are sigma = 0.5, k = 500, min = 20.
Larger values for k result in larger components in the result.
