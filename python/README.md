### Python script on Raspberry Pi
On top of the existing Caffe script I have added a Raspberry Pi Python demo that takes video continuously and record the image files to a ramdisk. You can turn on the ramdisk using the bash script under the folder

to start, run python cont\_record.py

make sure you have opencv installed
