For\n[API and internals documentation see my website](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/).\nThere's also an\n[in-browser online demo](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/#demo) (for Firefox,\nChrome and probably Safari).\n\nInstall\n-------\n\nFirst make sure you have installed the latest version of [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)\n(You may need to restart your computer after this step).\n\nFrom NPM for use as a command line app:\n\n    npm install uglify-js -g\n\nFrom NPM for programmatic use:\n\n    npm install uglify-js\n\nFrom Git:\n\n    git clone git://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2.git\n    cd UglifyJS2\n    npm link .\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n    uglifyjs [input files] [options]\n\nUglifyJS2 can take multiple input files.  It's recommended that you pass the\ninput files first, then pass the options.  UglifyJS will parse input files\nin sequence and apply any compression options.  The files are parsed in the\nsame global scope, that is, a reference from a file to some\nvariable/function declared in another file will be matched properly.\n\nIf you want to read from STDIN instead, pass a single dash instead of input\nfiles.\n\nThe available options are:\n\n    --source-map       Specify an output file where to generate source map.\n                                                                          [string]\n    --source-map-root  The path to the original source to be included in the\n                       source map.                                        [string]\n    --source-map-url   The path to the source map to be added in //@\n                       sourceMappingURL.  Defaults to the value passed with\n                       --source-map.                                      [string]\n    --in-source-map    Input source map, useful if you're compressing JS that was\n                       generated from some other original code.\n    --screw-ie8        Pass this flag if you don't care about full compliance with\n                       Internet Explorer 6-8 quirks (by default UglifyJS will try\n                       to be IE-proof).\n    -p, --prefix       Skip prefix for original filenames that appear in source\n                       maps. For example -p 3 will drop 3 directories from file\n                       names and ensure they are relative paths.\n    -o, --output       Output file (default STDOUT).\n    -b, --beautify     Beautify output/specify output options.            [string]\n    -m, --mangle       Mangle names/pass mangler options.                 [string]\n    -r, --reserved     Reserved names to exclude from mangling.\n    -c, --compress     Enable compressor/pass compressor options. Pass options\n                       like -c hoist_vars=false,if_return=false. Use -c with no\n                       argument to use the default compression options.   [string]\n    -d, --define       Global definitions                                 [string]\n    --comments         Preserve copyright comments in the output. By default this\n                       works like Google Closure, keeping JSDoc-style comments\n                       that contain \"@license\" or \"@preserve\". You can optionally\n                       pass one of the following arguments to this flag:\n                       - \"all\" to keep all comments\n                       - a valid JS regexp (needs to start with a slash) to keep\n                       only comments that match.\n                       Note that currently not *all* comments can be kept when\n                       compression is on, because of dead code removal or\n                       cascading statements into sequences.               [string]\n    --stats            Display operations run time on STDERR.            [boolean]\n    --acorn            Use Acorn for parsing.                            [boolean]\n    --spidermonkey     Assume input files are SpiderMonkey AST format (as JSON).\n                                                                         [boolean]\n    --self             Build itself (UglifyJS2) as a library (implies\n                       --wrap=UglifyJS --export-all)                     [boolean]\n    --wrap             Embed everything in a big function, making the “exports”\n                       and “global” variables available. You need to pass an\n                       argument to this option to specify the name that your\n                       module will take when included in, say, a browser.\n                                                                          [string]\n    --export-all       Only used when --wrap, this tells UglifyJS to add code to\n                       automatically export all globals.                 [boolean]\n    --lint             Display some scope warnings                       [boolean]\n    -v, --verbose      Verbose                                           [boolean]\n    -V, --version      Print version number and exit.                    [boolean]\n\nSpecify `--output` (`-o`) to declare the output file.  Otherwise the output\ngoes to STDOUT.\n\n## Source map options\n\nUglifyJS2 can generate a source map file, which is highly useful for\ndebugging your compressed JavaScript.  To get a source map, pass\n`--source-map output.js.map` (full path to the file where you want the\nsource map dumped).\n\nAdditionally you might need `--source-map-root` to pass the URL where the\noriginal files can be found.  In case you are passing full paths to input\nfiles to UglifyJS, you can use `--prefix` (`-p`) to specify the number of\ndirectories to drop from the path prefix when declaring files in the source\nmap.\n\nFor example:\n\n    uglifyjs /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file1.js \\\n             /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file2.js \\\n             -o foo.min.js \\\n             --source-map foo.min.js.map \\\n             --source-map-root http://foo.com/src \\\n             -p 5 -c -m\n\nThe above will compress and mangle `file1.js` and `file2.js`, will drop the\noutput in `foo.min.js` and the source map in `foo.min.js.map`.  The source\nmapping will refer to `http://foo.com/src/js/file1.js` and\n`http://foo.com/src/js/file2.js` (in fact it will list `http://foo.com/src`\nas the source map root, and the original files as `js/file1.js` and\n`js/file2.js`).\n\n### Composed source map\n\nWhen you're compressing JS code that was output by a compiler such as\nCoffeeScript, mapping to the JS code won't be too helpful.  Instead, you'd\nlike to map back to the original code (i.e. CoffeeScript).  UglifyJS has an\noption to take an input source map.  Assuming you have a mapping from\nCoffeeScript → compiled JS, UglifyJS can generate a map from CoffeeScript →\ncompressed JS by mapping every token in the compiled JS to its original\nlocation.\n\nTo use this feature you need to pass `--in-source-map\n/path/to/input/source.map`.  Normally the input source map should also point\nto the file containing the generated JS, so if that's correct you can omit\ninput files from the command line.\n\n## Mangler options\n\nTo enable the mangler you need to pass `--mangle` (`-m`).  The following\n(comma-separated) options are supported:\n\n- `sort` — to assign shorter names to most frequently used variables.  This\n  saves a few hundred bytes on jQuery before gzip, but the output is\n  _bigger_ after gzip (and seems to happen for other libraries I tried it\n  on) therefore it's not enabled by default.\n\n- `toplevel` — mangle names declared in the toplevel scope (disabled by\n  default).\n\n- `eval` — mangle names visible in scopes where `eval` or `when` are used\n  (disabled by default).\n\nWhen mangling is enabled but you want to prevent certain names from being\nmangled, you can declare those names with `--reserved` (`-r`) — pass a\ncomma-separated list of names.  For example:\n\n    uglifyjs ... -m -r '$,require,exports'\n\nto prevent the `require`, `exports` and `$` names from being changed.\n\n## Compressor options\n\nYou need to pass `--compress` (`-c`) to enable the compressor.  Optionally\nyou can pass a comma-separated list of options.  Options are in the form\n`foo=bar`, or just `foo` (the latter implies a boolean option that you want\nto set `true`; it's effectively a shortcut for `foo=true`).\n\n- `sequences` -- join consecutive simple statements using the comma operator\n- `properties` -- rewrite property access using the dot notation, for\n  example `foo[\"bar\"] → foo.bar`\n- `dead_code` -- remove unreachable code\n- `drop_debugger` -- remove `debugger;` statements\n- `unsafe` (default: false) -- apply \"unsafe\" transformations (discussion below)\n- `conditionals` -- apply optimizations for `if`-s and conditional\n  expressions\n- `comparisons` -- apply certain optimizations to binary nodes, for example:\n  `!(a <= b) → a > b` (only when `unsafe`), attempts to negate binary nodes,\n  e.g. `a = !b && !c && !d && !e → a=!(b||c||d||e)` etc.\n- `evaluate` -- attempt to evaluate constant expressions\n- `booleans` -- various optimizations for boolean context, for example `!!a\n  ? b : c → a ? b : c`\n- `loops` -- optimizations for `do`, `while` and `for` loops when we can\n  statically determine the condition\n- `unused` -- drop unreferenced functions and variables\n- `hoist_funs` -- hoist function declarations\n- `hoist_vars` (default: false) -- hoist `var` declarations (this is `false`\n  by default because it seems to increase the size of the output in general)\n- `if_return` -- optimizations for if/return and if/continue\n- `join_vars` -- join consecutive `var` statements\n- `cascade` -- small optimization for sequences, transform `x, x` into `x`\n  and `x = something(), x` into `x = something()`\n- `warnings` -- display warnings when dropping unreachable code or unused\n  declarations etc.\n\n### The `unsafe` option\n\nIt enables some transformations that *might* break code logic in certain\ncontrived cases, but should be fine for most code.  You might want to try it\non your own code, it should reduce the minified size.  Here's what happens\nwhen this flag is on:\n\n- `new Array(1, 2, 3)` or `Array(1, 2, 3)` → `[1, 2, 3 ]`\n- `new Object()` → `{}`\n- `String(exp)` or `exp.toString()` → `\"\" + exp`\n- `new Object/RegExp/Function/Error/Array (...)` → we discard the `new`\n- `typeof foo == \"undefined\"` → `foo === void 0`\n- `void 0` → `\"undefined\"` (if there is a variable named \"undefined\" in\n  scope; we do it because the variable name will be mangled, typically\n  reduced to a single character).\n\n### Conditional compilation\n\nYou can use the `--define` (`-d`) switch in order to declare global\nvariables that UglifyJS will assume to be constants (unless defined in\nscope).  For example if you pass `--define DEBUG=false` then, coupled with\ndead code removal UglifyJS will discard the following from the output:\n```javascript\nif (DEBUG) {\n\tconsole.log(\"debug stuff\");\n}\n```\n\nUglifyJS will warn about the condition being always false and about dropping\nunreachable code; for now there is no option to turn off only this specific\nwarning, you can pass `warnings=false` to turn off *all* warnings.\n\nAnother way of doing that is to declare your globals as constants in a\nseparate file and include it into the build.  For example you can have a\n`build/defines.js` file with the following:\n```javascript\nconst DEBUG = false;\nconst PRODUCTION = true;\n// etc.\n```\n\nand build your code like this:\n\n    uglifyjs build/defines.js js/foo.js js/bar.js... -c\n\nUglifyJS will notice the constants and, since they cannot be altered, it\nwill evaluate references to them to the value itself and drop unreachable\ncode as usual.  The possible downside of this approach is that the build\nwill contain the `const` declarations.\n\n<a name=\"codegen-options\"></a>\n## Beautifier options\n\nThe code generator tries to output shortest code possible by default.  In\ncase you want beautified output, pass `--beautify` (`-b`).  Optionally you\ncan pass additional arguments that control the code output:\n\n- `beautify` (default `true`) -- whether to actually beautify the output.\n  Passing `-b` will set this to true, but you might need to pass `-b` even\n  when you want to generate minified code, in order to specify additional\n  arguments, so you can use `-b beautify=false` to override it.\n- `indent-level` (default 4)\n- `indent-start` (default 0) -- prefix all lines by that many spaces\n- `quote-keys` (default `false`) -- pass `true` to quote all keys in literal\n  objects\n- `space-colon` (default `true`) -- insert a space after the colon signs\n- `ascii-only` (default `false`) -- escape Unicode characters in strings and\n  regexps\n- `inline-script` (default `false`) -- escape the slash in occurrences of\n  `</script` in strings\n- `width` (default 80) -- only takes effect when beautification is on, this\n  specifies an (orientative) line width that the beautifier will try to\n  obey.  It refers to the width of the line text (excluding indentation).\n  It doesn't work very well currently, but it does make the code generated\n  by UglifyJS more readable.\n- `max-line-len` (default 32000) -- maximum line length (for uglified code)\n- `ie-proof` (default `true`) -- generate “IE-proof” code (for now this\n  means add brackets around the do/while in code like this: `if (foo) do\n  something(); while (bar); else ...`.\n- `bracketize` (default `false`) -- always insert brackets in `if`, `for`,\n  `do`, `while` or `with` statements, even if their body is a single\n  statement.\n- `semicolons` (default `true`) -- separate statements with semicolons.  If\n  you pass `false` then whenever possible we will use a newline instead of a\n  semicolon, leading to more readable output of uglified code (size before\n  gzip could be smaller; size after gzip insignificantly larger).\n- `negate-iife` (default `!beautify`) -- prefer negation, rather than\n  parens, for \"Immediately-Called Function Expressions\".  This defaults to\n  `true` when beautification is off, and `false` if beautification is on;\n  pass it manually to force a value.\n\n### Keeping copyright notices or other comments\n\nYou can pass `--comments` to retain certain comments in the output.  By\ndefault it will keep JSDoc-style comments that contain \"@preserve\",\n\"@license\" or \"@cc_on\" (conditional compilation for IE).  You can pass\n`--comments all` to keep all the comments, or a valid JavaScript regexp to\nkeep only comments that match this regexp.  For example `--comments\n'/foo|bar/'` will keep only comments that contain \"foo\" or \"bar\".\n\nNote, however, that there might be situations where comments are lost.  For\nexample:\n```javascript\nfunction f() {\n\t/** @preserve Foo Bar */\n\tfunction g() {\n\t  // this function is never called\n\t}\n\treturn something();\n}\n```\n\nEven though it has \"@preserve\", the comment will be lost because the inner\nfunction `g` (which is the AST node to which the comment is attached to) is\ndiscarded by the compressor as not referenced.\n\nThe safest comments where to place copyright information (or other info that\nneeds to be kept in the output) are comments attached to toplevel nodes.\n\n## Support for the SpiderMonkey AST\n\nUglifyJS2 has its own abstract syntax tree format; for\n[practical reasons](http://lisperator.net/blog/uglifyjs-why-not-switching-to-spidermonkey-ast/)\nwe can't easily change to using the SpiderMonkey AST internally.  However,\nUglifyJS now has a converter which can import a SpiderMonkey AST.\n\nFor example [Acorn][acorn] is a super-fast parser that produces a\nSpiderMonkey AST.  It has a small CLI utility that parses one file and dumps\nthe AST in JSON on the standard output.  To use UglifyJS to mangle and\ncompress that:\n\n    acorn file.js | uglifyjs --spidermonkey -m -c\n\nThe `--spidermonkey` option tells UglifyJS that all input files are not\nJavaScript, but JS code described in SpiderMonkey AST in JSON.  Therefore we\ndon't use our own parser in this case, but just transform that AST into our\ninternal AST.\n\n### Use Acorn for parsing\n\nMore for fun, I added the `--acorn` option which will use Acorn to do all\nthe parsing.  If you pass this option, UglifyJS will `require(\"acorn\")`.\n\nAcorn is really fast (e.g. 250ms instead of 380ms on some 650K code), but\nconverting the SpiderMonkey tree that Acorn produces takes another 150ms so\nin total it's a bit more than just using UglifyJS's own parser.\n\nAPI Reference\n-------------\n\nAssuming installation via NPM, you can load UglifyJS in your application\nlike this:\n```javascript\nvar UglifyJS = require(\"uglify-js\");\n```\n\nIt exports a lot of names, but I'll discuss here the basics that are needed\nfor parsing, mangling and compressing a piece of code.  The sequence is (1)\nparse, (2) compress, (3) mangle, (4) generate output code.\n\n### The simple way\n\nThere's a single toplevel function which combines all the steps.  If you\ndon't need additional customization, you might want to go with `minify`.\nExample:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify(\"/path/to/file.js\");\nconsole.log(result.code); // minified output\n// if you need to pass code instead of file name\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify(\"var b = function () {};\", {fromString: true});\n```\n\nYou can also compress multiple files:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ]);\nconsole.log(result.code);\n```\n\nTo generate a source map:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ], {\n\toutSourceMap: \"out.js.map\"\n});\nconsole.log(result.code); // minified output\nconsole.log(result.map);\n```\n\nNote that the source map is not saved in a file, it's just returned in\n`result.map`.  The value passed for `outSourceMap` is only used to set the\n`file` attribute in the source map (see [the spec][sm-spec]).\n\nYou can also specify sourceRoot property to be included in source map:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ], {\n\toutSourceMap: \"out.js.map\",\n\tsourceRoot: \"http://example.com/src\"\n});\n```\n\nIf you're compressing compiled JavaScript and have a source map for it, you\ncan use the `inSourceMap` argument:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify(\"compiled.js\", {\n\tinSourceMap: \"compiled.js.map\",\n\toutSourceMap: \"minified.js.map\"\n});\n// same as before, it returns `code` and `map`\n```\n\nThe `inSourceMap` is only used if you also request `outSourceMap` (it makes\nno sense otherwise).\n\nOther options:\n\n- `warnings` (default `false`) — pass `true` to display compressor warnings.\n\n- `fromString` (default `false`) — if you pass `true` then you can pass\n  JavaScript source code, rather than file names.\n\n- `mangle` — pass `false` to skip mangling names.\n\n- `output` (default `null`) — pass an object if you wish to specify\n  additional [output options][codegen].  The defaults are optimized\n  for best compression.\n\n- `compress` (default `{}`) — pass `false` to skip compressing entirely.\n  Pass an object to specify custom [compressor options][compressor].\n\nWe could add more options to `UglifyJS.minify` — if you need additional\nfunctionality please suggest!\n\n### The hard way\n\nFollowing there's more detailed API info, in case the `minify` function is\ntoo simple for your needs.\n\n#### The parser\n```javascript\nvar toplevel_ast = UglifyJS.parse(code, options);\n```\n\n`options` is optional and if present it must be an object.  The following\nproperties are available:\n\n- `strict` — disable automatic semicolon insertion and support for trailing\n  comma in arrays and objects\n- `filename` — the name of the file where this code is coming from\n- `toplevel` — a `toplevel` node (as returned by a previous invocation of\n  `parse`)\n\nThe last two options are useful when you'd like to minify multiple files and\nget a single file as the output and a proper source map.  Our CLI tool does\nsomething like this:\n```javascript\nvar toplevel = null;\nfiles.forEach(function(file){\n\tvar code = fs.readFileSync(file);\n\ttoplevel = UglifyJS.parse(code, {\n\t\tfilename: file,\n\t\ttoplevel: toplevel\n\t});\n});\n```\n\nAfter this, we have in `toplevel` a big AST containing all our files, with\neach token having proper information about where it came from.\n\n#### Scope information\n\nUglifyJS contains a scope analyzer that you need to call manually before\ncompressing or mangling.  Basically it augments various nodes in the AST\nwith information about where is a name defined, how many times is a name\nreferenced, if it is a global or not, if a function is using `eval` or the\n`with` statement etc.  I will discuss this some place else, for now what's\nimportant to know is that you need to call the following before doing\nanything with the tree:\n```javascript\ntoplevel.figure_out_scope()\n```\n\n#### Compression\n\nLike this:\n```javascript\nvar compressor = UglifyJS.Compressor(options);\nvar compressed_ast = toplevel.transform(compressor);\n```\n\nThe `options` can be missing.  Available options are discussed above in\n“Compressor options”.  Defaults should lead to best compression in most\nscripts.\n\nThe compressor is destructive, so don't rely that `toplevel` remains the\noriginal tree.\n\n#### Mangling\n\nAfter compression it is a good idea to call again `figure_out_scope` (since\nthe compressor might drop unused variables / unreachable code and this might\nchange the number of identifiers or their position).  Optionally, you can\ncall a trick that helps after Gzip (counting character frequency in\nnon-mangleable words).  Example:\n```javascript\ncompressed_ast.figure_out_scope();\ncompressed_ast.compute_char_frequency();\ncompressed_ast.mangle_names();\n```\n\n#### Generating output\n\nAST nodes have a `print` method that takes an output stream.  Essentially,\nto generate code you do this:\n```javascript\nvar stream = UglifyJS.OutputStream(options);\ncompressed_ast.print(stream);\nvar code = stream.toString(); // this is your minified code\n```\n\nor, for a shortcut you can do:\n```javascript\nvar code = compressed_ast.print_to_string(options);\n```\n\nAs usual, `options` is optional.  The output stream accepts a lot of otions,\nmost of them documented above in section “Beautifier options”.  The two\nwhich we care about here are `source_map` and `comments`.\n\n#### Keeping comments in the output\n\nIn order to keep certain comments in the output you need to pass the\n`comments` option.  Pass a RegExp or a function.  If you pass a RegExp, only\nthose comments whose body matches the regexp will be kept.  Note that body\nmeans without the initial `//` or `/*`.  If you pass a function, it will be\ncalled for every comment in the tree and will receive two arguments: the\nnode that the comment is attached to, and the comment token itself.\n\nThe comment token has these properties:\n\n- `type`: \"comment1\" for single-line comments or \"comment2\" for multi-line\n  comments\n- `value`: the comment body\n- `pos` and `endpos`: the start/end positions (zero-based indexes) in the\n  original code where this comment appears\n- `line` and `col`: the line and column where this comment appears in the\n  original code\n- `file` — the file name of the original file\n- `nlb` — true if there was a newline before this comment in the original\n  code, or if this comment contains a newline.\n\nYour function should return `true` to keep the comment, or a falsy value\notherwise.\n\n#### Generating a source mapping\n\nYou need to pass the `source_map` argument when calling `print`.  It needs\nto be a `SourceMap` object (which is a thin wrapper on top of the\n[source-map][source-map] library).\n\nExample:\n```javascript\nvar source_map = UglifyJS.SourceMap(source_map_options);\nvar stream = UglifyJS.OutputStream({\n\t...\n\tsource_map: source_map\n});\ncompressed_ast.print(stream);\n\nvar code = stream.toString();\nvar map = source_map.toString(); // json output for your source map\n```\n\nThe `source_map_options` (optional) can contain the following properties:\n\n- `file`: the name of the JavaScript output file that this mapping refers to\n- `root`: the `sourceRoot` property (see the [spec][sm-spec])\n- `orig`: the \"original source map\", handy when you compress generated JS\n  and want to map the minified output back to the original code where it\n  came from.  It can be simply a string in JSON, or a JSON object containing\n  the original source map.\n\n  [acorn]: https://github.com/marijnh/acorn\n  [source-map]: https://github.com/mozilla/source-map\n  [sm-spec]: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit\n  [codegen]: http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/codegen\n  [compressor]: http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/compress\n",
