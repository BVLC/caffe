# Contributing to Apache Cordova

Anyone can contribute to Cordova. And we need your contributions.

There are multiple ways to contribute: report bugs, improve the docs, and
contribute code.

For instructions on this, start with the 
[contribution overview](http://cordova.apache.org/contribute/).

The details are explained there, but the important items are:
 - Sign and submit an Apache ICLA (Contributor License Agreement).
 - Have a Jira issue open that corresponds to your contribution.
 - Run the tests so your patch doesn't break existing functionality.

We look forward to your contributions!
