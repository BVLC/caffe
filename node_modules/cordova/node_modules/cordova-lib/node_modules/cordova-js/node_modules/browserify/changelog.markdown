# 10.1.1

ensures that entry paths are always full paths

https://github.com/substack/node-browserify/pull/1248

# 10.1.0

adds `--no-browser-field` and `opts.browserField = false` behavior to turn off
the package.json browser field. This is useful if you want to make a bundle with
a target of node or some environment with shimmed node primitives.

A new alias `--node` sets `--no-browser-field` and `--bare`.

# 10.0.0

## Possibly Breaking Change
The ‘process’ dependency was updated to ~0.11.0, this module is inserted into bundles as the ‘process’ global/dependency.
Previously, an unhandled error thrown in a ‘process.nextTick’ task would prevent any subsequent tasks from running, forever.
The task queue now recovers from this condition, but may do so on a future browser tick.
As part of this update, ‘process.nextTick’ now accepts variadic arguments, passed to the task, added to io.js in 1.8.1.

fixes some file path leaks in deduped deps

https://github.com/substack/node-browserify/pull/994
https://github.com/substack/node-browserify/issues/951

# 8.0.0

In previous releases, the deduping logic was over-zealous about how it handled
module references for duplicates. The prior behavior would detect when the
dependency tree of a module matched an existing module in addition to having the
exact same source code to share an instance. This was originally designed to
support libraries like threejs that internally use `instanceof` checks that
don't usually work very well across multiple packages. This feature didn't pan
out and didn't work very well in practice.

Later, a better way of deduping emerged after some unrelated tweaks to
browser-pack to support source introspection for webworkers. The reflection form
of deduping using implicit arguments is now the only kind.

The deduping instance feature resulted in this bug:
https://github.com/substack/node-browserify/issues/1027
which created very surprising results when duplicate files were in use.

# 7.1.0

uses the new buffer@3.0.0, which passes node's own buffer test suite

https://github.com/substack/node-browserify/pull/1040

https://github.com/substack/node-browserify/issues/1012

also fixes https://github.com/substack/node-browserify/issues/1015

# 7.0.0

Global transforms are now resolved to an absolute path before walking files.
This fixes some bugs with local module versions taking precedence over global
transforms and unresolvable global transforms spanning system directories.

This is a small breaking change since now transform objects live in the pipeline
between the record and deps phases. This should only affect programs that expect
records in the pipeline to only contain file objects.

# 6.0.0

resolves source map maths relative to the base url. This should help with more
reproducible builds.

https://github.com/substack/node-browserify/pull/923

Version 6 is a tiny but breaking change to how source map paths work.

Now all source map paths are relative by default. This makes it easier to have
deterministic debug builds across different systems and directories. If
browserify is installed in a project-local directory, all the source map paths
will be self-contained and relative against that location in node_modules.

# 5.0.1

adds an untracked test

# 5.0.0

At a glance:

* extensible internal labeled-stream-splicer pipeline
* bundle() - no longer accepts `opts`, callback gets a buffer 
* b.deps(), b.pack(), opts.pack, opts.deps are gone
* can call bundle() multiple times on the same instance
* a better --noparse matcher
* id labeling integer index based instead of hash based
* derequire removed for performance reasons
* .external(bundle) has been removed (for now)
* semicolon at end of output
* hashing is gone so `expose: true` or explicit expose id is required for doing
multi-export bundles

Version 5 is a big rearranging of browserify internals with more places for
external code to hook into the build pipeline.

These changes are mostly aligned around the theme of making it easier for
external code to interface with browserify internals in a less hacky way.

## pipeline

Now the core of browserify is organized into a
[labeled-stream-splicer](https://npmjs.org/package/labeled-stream-splicer)
pipeline. This means that user code and plugins can hook into browserify by
pushing themselves onto the pipeline at a label:

``` js
var browserify = require('browserify');
var through = require('through2');
var bundle = browserify();

bundle.pipeline.get('deps').push(through.obj(function (row, enc, next) {
    console.log('DEP:', row.id);
    this.push(row);
    next();
}));
```

User code can remove existing transforms or add its own hooks. These are the
labeled sections you can get a handle on with `bundle.pipeline.get()`

* `'record'` - save inputs to play back later on subsequent `bundle()` calls
* `'deps'` - [module-deps](https://npmjs.org/package/module-deps)
* `'unbom'` - remove byte-order markers
* `'syntax'` - check for syntax errors
* `'sort'` - sort the dependencies for deterministic bundles
* `'dedupe'` - remove duplicate source contents
* `'label'` - apply integer labels to files
* `'emit-deps'` - emit `'dep'` event
* `'debug'` - apply source maps
* `'pack'` - [browser-pack](https://npmjs.org/package/browser-pack)
* `'wrap'` - apply final wrapping, `require=` and a newline and semicolon

Because there is now a proper pipeline, `opts.pack`, `opts.deps`, `b.deps()`,
and `b.pack()` are removed.

## bundle()

Big changes have been made to the `bundle()` function. All options have been
moved out of the `bundle(opts)` form and into the browserify constructor. Before
there was an unclear split between which arguments went into which function.

You can now call `bundle()` multiple times on the same instance, even in
parallel. This will greatly simplify the caching system under watchify and will
fix many long-standing bugs.

The callback to `bundle(cb)` is now called with `cb(err, buf)` instead of
`cb(err, string)` as before.

## labeling

The former hashing system is removed, in favor of file paths rooted at the
`opts.basedir`, or the cwd.

This removal means that browserify can be much more consistent about applying
integer ids, which avoids exposing system paths in bundle output.

Hashes are used internally for deduping purposes, but they operate on the
source content only.

## others

The matching logic in the `--noparse` feature is greatly improved.

derequire has been taken out of core, which should speed up `--standalone`.

# 4.2.3

reverts 4.2.2 due to breaking some existing use-cases

# 4.2.2

fixes a bug applying transforms to symlinked files by resolving the realpath
first https://github.com/substack/node-browserify/pull/831

# 4.2.1

SECURITY NOTICE

Make sure your installation of browserify is using syntax-error@1.1.1 or
later. there was a security vulnerability where a malicious file could
execute code when browserified.

The vulnerability involves breaking out of `Function()`, which was used to
check syntax for more informative errors. In node 0.10, `Function()` seems
to be implemented in terms of `eval()`, so malicious code can execute even
if the function returned by `Function()` was never called. node 0.11 does
not appear to be vulnerable.

# 4.0

Here are the new breaking changes in browserify v4. Most users should be unaffected.

## readable-stream

`require('stream')` is now using [readable-stream](https://npmjs.org/package/readable-stream) (but the classic-mode shim persists in stream-browserify just like in node core). This should result in much smaller files for all modules using a similar-enough version of readable-stream as browserify itself. Other modules should be relatively unaffected.

## removed .expose()

Removal of the previously-deprecated and obscure `bundle.expose()`.

## took out implicit reading from stdin

Previously if you invoked the browserify command without any entry files as arguments and stdin was a tty, stdin would be implicitly added as an entry file. This feature was causing problems so it has been removed. https://github.com/substack/node-browserify/issues/724#issuecomment-42731877

## more!

In the run-up to the 4.0, [module-deps](https://npmjs.org/package/module-deps) got an extensive rewrite with minimal test changes. Mostly it was just getting really messy because it was a giant ball-of-mud closure instead of a more straightforward prototype-based implementation with more clearly-defined methods.

The module-deps rewrite was triggered by [system paths showing up in build output](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify/issues/675) but was fixed in 3.46.1. The solution actually didn't end up needing changes in module-deps as originally anticipated but module-deps was in dire need of a cleanup.

A new [browserify](http://browserify.org) version is upon us, just in time for
the FESTIVE SEASON during which we in the northern hemisphere at mid to high
latitudes huddle for warmth around oxidizing hydrocarbons!

There are 2 big changes in v3 but most code should be relatively unaffected.

## shiny new Buffer

[feross](https://github.com/feross) forked
the [buffer-browserify](https://npmjs.org/package/buffer-browserify) package
to create 
[native-buffer-browserify](https://npmjs.org/package/native-buffer-browserify),
a `Buffer` implementation that uses `Uint8Array` to get `buf[i]` notation and
parity with the node core `Buffer` api without the performance hit of the
previous implementation and a much smaller file size. The downside is that
`Buffer` now only works in browsers with `Uint8Array` and `DataView` support.
All the other modules should maintain existing browser support.

*Update*: a [shim was added](https://npmjs.org/package/typedarray)
to in 3.1 for Uint8Array and DataView support. Now you can use `Buffer` in every
browser.

## direct builtin dependencies

In v3, browserify no longer depends on
[browser-builtins](https://npmjs.org/package/browser-builtins), in favor of
depending on packages directly. Instead of having some separate packages and
some files in a `builtin/` directory like browser-builtins, browserify now uses
*only* external packages for the shims it uses. By only using external packages
we can keep browserify core focused purely on the static analysis and bundling
machinery while letting the individual packages worry about things like browser
compatibility and parity with the node core API as it evolves.

Individual, tiny packages should also be much easier for newcomers to contribute
packages toward because they won't need to get up to speed with all the other
pieces going on and the packages can have their own tests and documentation.
Additionally, each package may find uses in other projects beside browserify
more easily and if people want variations on the versions of shims that ship
with browserify core this is easier to do when everything is separate.

Back when we were using browser-builtins there was a large latency between
pushing out fixes to the individual packages and getting them into browserify
core because we had to wait on browser-builtins to upgrade the semvers in its
package.json. With direct dependencies we get much lower latency for package
upgrades and much more granular control over upgrading packages.

Here is the list of packages we now directly depend on in v3:

* [assert](https://npmjs.org/package/assert)
* [buffer](https://npmjs.org/package/native-buffer-browserify)
* [console](https://npmjs.org/package/console-browserify)
* [constants](https://npmjs.org/package/constants-browserify)
* [crypto](https://npmjs.org/package/crypto-browserify)
* [events](https://npmjs.org/package/events-browserify)
* [http](https://npmjs.org/package/http-browserify)
* [https](https://npmjs.org/package/https-browserify)
* [os](https://npmjs.org/package/os-browserify)
* [path](https://npmjs.org/package/path-browserify)
* [punycode](https://npmjs.org/package/punycode)
* [querystring](https://npmjs.org/package/querystring)
* [stream](https://npmjs.org/package/stream-browserify)
* [string_decoder](https://npmjs.org/package/string_decoder)
* [timers](https://npmjs.org/package/timers-browserify)
* [tty](https://npmjs.org/package/tty-browserify)
* [url](https://npmjs.org/package/url)
* [util](https://npmjs.org/package/util)
* [vm](https://npmjs.org/package/vm-browserify)
* [zlib](https://npmjs.org/package/zlib-browserify)

That's it! If you're bold enough to give v3 a spin, just do:

```
npm install -g browserify
```
