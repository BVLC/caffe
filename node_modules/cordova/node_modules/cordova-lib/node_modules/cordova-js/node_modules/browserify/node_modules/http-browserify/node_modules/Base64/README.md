# Base64.js

â‰ˆ 500 byte* polyfill for browsers which don't provide [`window.btoa`][1] and
[`window.atob`][2].

Although the script does no harm in browsers which do provide these functions,
a conditional script loader such as [yepnope][3] can prevent unnecessary HTTP
requests.

```javascript
yepnope({
  test: window.btoa && window.atob,
  nope: 'base64.js',
  callback: function () {
    // `btoa` and `atob` are now safe to use
  }
})
```

Base64.js stems from a [gist][4] by [yahiko][5].
