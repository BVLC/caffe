Note that these image resources are not copied into a project when a project
is created with the CLI. Although there are default image resources in a
newly-created project, those come from the platform-specific project template,
which can generally be found in the platform's `template` directory. Until
icon and splashscreen support is added to the CLI, these image resources
aren't used directly.
