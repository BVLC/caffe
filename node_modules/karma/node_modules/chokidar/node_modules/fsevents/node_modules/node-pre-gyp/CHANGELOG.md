 - BREAKING: node odd releases like v0.11.x now use `major.minor.patch` for `{node_abi}` instead of `NODE_MODULE_VERSION` (#124)

 - Added support for `--no-rollback` option to request that a failed binary test does not remove the binary module leaves it in place.
 - Added support for `--update-binary` option to request an existing binary be re-installed and the check for a valid local module be skipped.
