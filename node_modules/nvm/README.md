# nvm

Install and managing different versions of node and linking local versions into specific directories. Very simple setup and no need for a special shell.

# Install

You do have to have at least one version of node and npm to get started, but after that you can install `nvm` with `npm`.

```bash
$ npm install -g nvm
```

# Setup
You must update your path to include ./node_modules/.bin

```bash
export PATH=./node_modules/.bin:$PATH
```

Note, this is a good thing to do anyway â€“ it will allow you to run things like `jshint` on a per-repo basis without having to install it globally and without having to prefix the path.
