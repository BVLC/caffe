# regex-cache [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/regex-cache.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/regex-cache)  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jonschlinkert/regex-cache.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/jonschlinkert/regex-cache) 

> Memoize the results of a call to the RegExp constructor, avoiding repetitious runtime compilation of the same string and options, resulting in dramatic speed improvements.

- Read [what this does](#what-this-does).
- See [the benchmarks](#benchmarks)

## Install with [npm](npmjs.org)

```bash
npm i regex-cache --save
```

## Usage

Wrap a function like this:

```js
var cache = require('regex-cache');
var someRegex = cache(require('some-regex-lib'));
```

**Caching a regex**

If you want to cache a regex after calling `new RegExp()`, or you're requiring a module that returns a regex, wrap it with a function first: 

```js
var cache = require('regex-cache');

function yourRegex(str, opts) {
  // do stuff to str and opts
  return new RegExp(str, opts.flags);
}

var regex = cache(yourRegex);
```

## Recommendations

### Use this when...

* **No options are passed** to the function that creates the regex. Regardless of how big or small the regex is, when zero options are passed, caching will be faster than not.
* **A few options are passed**, and the values are primitives. The limited benchmarks I did show that caching is beneficial when up to 8 or 9 options are passed.

### Do not use this when...

* **The values of options are not primitives**. When non-primitives must be compared for equality, the time to compare the options is most likely as long or longer than the time to just create a new regex.

## Run benchmarks

Install dev dependencies:

```bash
npm i -d && npm run benchmarks
```


## What this does

If you're using `new RegExp('foo')` instead of a regex literal, it's probably because you need to dyamically generate a regex based on user options or some other potentially changing factors. 

When your function creates a string based on user inputs and passes it to the `RegExp` constructor, regex-cache caches the results. The next time the function is called if the key of a cached regex matches the user input (or no input was given), the cached regex is returned, avoiding unnecessary runtime compilation.

Using the RegExp constructor offers a lot of flexibility, but the runtime compilation comes at a price - it's slow. Not specifically because of the call to the RegExp constructor, but **because you have to build up the string before `new RegExp()` is even called**.


## Run tests

Install dev dependencies:

```bash
npm i -d && npm test
```
