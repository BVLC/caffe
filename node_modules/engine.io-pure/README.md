# Engine.IO: the realtime engine

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/Automattic/engine.io.png)](http://travis-ci.org/Automattic/engine.io)
[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/engine.io.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/engine.io)

`Engine.IO` is the implementation of transport-based
cross-browser/cross-device bi-directional communication layer for
[Socket.IO](http://github.com/learnboost/socket.io).

## How to use

### Server

#### (A) Listening on a port

```js
var engine = require('engine.io');
var server = engine.listen(80);

server.on('connection', function(socket){
  socket.send('utf 8 string');
  socket.send(new Buffer([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])); // binary data
});
```

#### (B) Intercepting requests for a http.Server

```js
var engine = require('engine.io');
var http = require('http').createServer().listen(3000);
var server = engine.attach(http);

server.on('connection', function (socket) {
  socket.on('message', function(data){ });
  socket.on('close', function(){ });
});
```

#### (C) Passing in requests

```js
var engine = require('engine.io');
var server = new engine.Server();

server.on('connection', function(socket){
  socket.send('hi');
});

// …
httpServer.on('upgrade', function(req, socket, head){
  server.handleUpgrade(req, socket, head);
});
httpServer.on('request', function(req, res){
  server.handleRequest(req, res);
});
```

### Client

```html
<script src="/path/to/engine.io.js"></script>
<script>
  var socket = new eio.Socket('ws://localhost/');
  socket.on('open', function(){
    socket.on('message', function(data){});
    socket.on('close', function(){});
  });
</script>
```

For more information on the client refer to the
[engine-client](http://github.com/learnboost/engine.io-client) repository.

- **Maximum reliability**. Connections are established even in the presence of:
  - proxies and load balancers.
  - personal firewall and antivirus software.
  - for more information refer to **Goals** and **Architecture** sections
- **Minimal client size** aided by:
  - lazy loading of flash transports.
  - lack of redundant transports.
- **Scalable**
  - load balancer friendly
- **Future proof**
- **100% Node.JS core style**
  - No API sugar (left for higher level projects)
  - Written in readable vanilla JavaScript

## API

### Server

<hr><br>

#### Top-level

These are exposed by `require('engine.io')`:

##### Events

- `flush`
    - Called when a socket buffer is being flushed.
    - **Arguments**
      - `Socket`: socket being flushed
      - `Array`: write buffer
- `drain`
    - Called when a socket buffer is drained
    - **Arguments**
      - `Socket`: socket being flushed

##### Properties

- `protocol` _(Number)_: protocol revision number
- `Server`: Server class constructor
- `Socket`: Socket class constructor
- `Transport` _(Function)_: transport constructor
- `transports` _(Object)_: map of available transports

##### Methods

- `()`
    - Returns a new `Server` instance. If the first argument is an `http.Server` then the
      new `Server` instance will be attached to it. Otherwise, the arguments are passed
      directly to the `Server` constructor.
    - **Parameters**
      - `http.Server`: optional, server to attach to.
      - `Object`: optional, options object (see `Server#constructor` api docs below)

  The following are identical ways to instantiate a server and then attach it.
  ```js
  var httpServer; // previously created with `http.createServer();` from node.js api.

  // create a server first, and then attach
  var eioServer = require('engine.io').Server();
  eioServer.attach(httpServer);

  // or call the module as a function to get `Server`
  var eioServer = require('engine.io')();
  eioServer.attach(httpServer);

  // immediately attach
  var eioServer = require('engine.io')(httpServer);
  ```

- `listen`
    - Creates an `http.Server` which listens on the given port and attaches WS
      to it. It returns `501 Not Implemented` for regular http requests.
    - **Parameters**
      - `Number`: port to listen on.
      - `Object`: optional, options object
      - `Function`: callback for `listen`.
    - **Options**
      - All options from `Server.attach` method, documented below.
      - **Additionally** See Server `constructor` below for options you can pass for creating the new Server
    - **Returns** `Server`
- `attach`
    - Captures `upgrade` requests for a `http.Server`. In other words, makes
      a regular http.Server WebSocket-compatible.
    - **Parameters**
      - `http.Server`: server to attach to.
      - `Object`: optional, options object
    - **Options**
      - All options from `Server.attach` method, documented below.
      - **Additionally** See Server `constructor` below for options you can pass for creating the new Server
    - **Returns** `Server` a new Server instance.

### Client

<hr><br>

Exposed in the `eio` global namespace (in the browser), or by
`require('engine.io-client')` (in Node.JS).

For the client API refer to the 
[engine-client](http://github.com/learnboost/engine.io-client) repository.

## Debug / logging

Engine.IO is powered by [debug](http://github.com/visionmedia/debug).
In order to see all the debug output, run your app with the environment variable
`DEBUG` including the desired scope.

To see the output from all of Engine.IO's debugging scopes you can use:

```
DEBUG=engine* node myapp
```

## Transports

- `polling`: XHR / JSONP polling transport.
- `websocket`: WebSocket transport.

## Plugins

- [engine.io-conflation](https://github.com/EugenDueck/engine.io-conflation): Makes **conflation and aggregation** of messages straightforward.

## Support

The support channels for `engine.io` are the same as `socket.io`:
  - irc.freenode.net **#socket.io**
  - [Google Groups](http://groups.google.com/group/socket_io)
  - [Website](http://socket.io)

## Development

To contribute patches, run tests or benchmarks, make sure to clone the
repository:

```
git clone git://github.com/LearnBoost/engine.io.git
```

Then:

```
cd engine.io
npm install
```

## Tests

Tests run with `make test`. It runs the server tests that are aided by
the usage of `engine.io-client`.

Make sure `npm install` is run first.

## Goals

The main goal of `Engine` is ensuring the most reliable realtime communication.
Unlike the previous Socket.IO core, it always establishes a long-polling
connection first, then tries to upgrade to better transports that are "tested" on
the side.

During the lifetime of the Socket.IO projects, we've found countless drawbacks
to relying on `HTML5 WebSocket` or `Flash Socket` as the first connection
mechanisms.

Both are clearly the _right way_ of establishing a bidirectional communication,
with HTML5 WebSocket being the way of the future. However, to answer most business
needs, alternative traditional HTTP 1.1 mechanisms are just as good as delivering
the same solution.

WebSocket based connections have two fundamental benefits:

1. **Better server performance**
  - _A: Load balancers_<br>
      Load balancing a long polling connection poses a serious architectural nightmare
      since requests can come from any number of open sockets by the user agent, but
      they all need to be routed to the process and computer that owns the `Engine`
      connection. This negatively impacts RAM and CPU usage.
  - _B: Network traffic_<br>
      WebSocket is designed around the premise that each message frame has to be 
      surrounded by the least amount of data. In HTTP 1.1 transports, each message
      frame is surrounded by HTTP headers and chunked encoding frames. If you try to
      send the message _"Hello world"_ with xhr-polling, the message ultimately
      becomes larger than if you were to send it with WebSocket.
  - _C: Lightweight parser_<br>
      As an effect of **B**, the server has to do a lot more work to parse the network
      data and figure out the message when traditional HTTP requests are used
      (as in long polling). This means that another advantage of WebSocket is
      less server CPU usage.

2. **Better user experience**

    Due to the reasons stated in point **1**, the most important effect of being able
    to establish a WebSocket connection is raw data transfer speed, which translates
    in _some_ cases in better user experience.

    Applications with heavy realtime interaction (such as games) will benefit greatly,
    whereas applications like realtime chat (Gmail/Facebook), newsfeeds (Facebook) or
    timelines (Twitter) will have negligible user experience improvements.

Having said this, attempting to establish a WebSocket connection directly so far has
proven problematic:

1. **Proxies**<br>
    Many corporate proxies block WebSocket traffic.

2. **Personal firewall and antivirus software**<br>
    As a result of our research, we've found that at least 3 personal security
    applications block WebSocket traffic.

3. **Cloud application platforms**<br>
    Platforms like Heroku or No.de have had trouble keeping up with the fast-paced
    nature of the evolution of the WebSocket protocol. Applications therefore end up
    inevitably using long polling, but the seamless installation experience of 
    Socket.IO we strive for (_"require() it and it just works"_) disappears.

Some of these problems have solutions. In the case of proxies and personal programs,
however, the solutions many times involve upgrading software. Experience has shown
that relying on client software upgrades to deliver a business solution is
fruitless: the very existence of this project has to do with a fragmented panorama
of user agent distribution, with clients connecting with latest versions of the most
modern user agents (Chrome, Firefox and Safari), but others with versions as low as
IE 5.5.

From the user perspective, an unsuccessful WebSocket connection can translate in
up to at least 10 seconds of waiting for the realtime application to begin
exchanging data. This **perceptively** hurts user experience.

To summarize, **Engine** focuses on reliability and user experience first, marginal
potential UX improvements and increased server performance second. `Engine` is the
result of all the lessons learned with WebSocket in the wild.

## Architecture

The main premise of `Engine`, and the core of its existence, is the ability to
swap transports on the fly. A connection starts as xhr-polling, but it can
switch to WebSocket.

The central problem this poses is: how do we switch transports without losing
messages?

`Engine` only switches from polling to another transport in between polling
cycles. Since the server closes the connection after a certain timeout when
there's no activity, and the polling transport implementation buffers messages
in between connections, this ensures no message loss and optimal performance.

Another benefit of this design is that we workaround almost all the limitations
of **Flash Socket**, such as slow connection times, increased file size (we can
safely lazy load it without hurting user experience), etc.

## FAQ

### Can I use engine without Socket.IO ?

Absolutely. Although the recommended framework for building realtime applications
is Socket.IO, since it provides fundamental features for real-world applications 
such as multiplexing, reconnection support, etc.

`Engine` is to Socket.IO what Connect is to Express. An essential piece for building
realtime frameworks, but something you _probably_ won't be using for building
actual applications.

### Does the server serve the client?

No. The main reason is that `Engine` is meant to be bundled with frameworks.
Socket.IO includes `Engine`, therefore serving two clients is not necessary. If
you use Socket.IO, including

```html
<script src="/socket.io/socket.io.js">
```

has you covered.

### Can I implement `Engine` in other languages?

Absolutely. The [engine.io-protocol](https://github.com/LearnBoost/engine.io-protocol)
repository contains the most up to date description of the specification
at all times, and the parser implementation in JavaScript.
