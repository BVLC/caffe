`rm -rf` for node.

Install with `npm install rimraf`, or just drop rimraf.js somewhere.

## API

`rimraf(f, callback)`

The callback will be called with an error if there is one.  Certain
errors are handled for you:

* Windows: `EBUSY` and `ENOTEMPTY` - rimraf will back off a maximum of
  `opts.maxBusyTries` times before giving up.
* `ENOENT` - If the file doesn't exist, rimraf will return
  successfully, since your desired outcome is already the case.

## rimraf.sync

It can remove stuff synchronously, too.  But that's not so good.  Use
the async API.  It's better.

## CLI

If installed with `npm install rimraf -g` it can be used as a global
command `rimraf <path>` which is useful for cross platform support.

## mkdirp

If you need to create a directory recursively, check out
[mkdirp](https://github.com/substack/node-mkdirp).
