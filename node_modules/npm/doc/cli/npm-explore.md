npm-explore(1) -- Browse an installed package
=============================================

## SYNOPSIS

    npm explore <pkg> [ -- <cmd>]

## DESCRIPTION

Spawn a subshell in the directory of the installed package specified.

If a command is specified, then it is run in the subshell, which then
immediately terminates.

This is particularly handy in the case of git submodules in the
`node_modules` folder:

    npm explore some-dependency -- git pull origin master

Note that the package is *not* automatically rebuilt afterwards, so be
sure to use `npm rebuild <pkg>` if you make any changes.

## CONFIGURATION

### shell

* Default: SHELL environment variable, or "bash" on Posix, or "cmd" on
  Windows
* Type: path

The shell to run for the `npm explore` command.
