## Installation

### As library

    npm install cardinal

### As Commandline Tool

    [sudo] npm install -g cardinal

**Note:** 

When installed globally, cardinal exposes itself as the `cdl` command.

## Commandline

### Highlight a file

    cdl <file.js> [options]

**options**:
  - `--nonum`: turns off line number printing (relevant if it is turned on inside `~/.cardinalrc`

### As part of a UNIX pipe

    cat file.js | grep console | cdl

**Note:**

Not all code lines may be parsable JavaScript. In these cases the line is printed to the terminal without
highlighting it.

### Theme

The default theme will be used for highlighting.

To use a different theme, include a `.cardinalrc` file in your `HOME` directory.

This is a JSON file of the following form:

```json
{
  "theme": "hide-semicolons",
  "linenos": true|false
}
```

- `theme` can be the name of any of the [built-in themes](https://github.com/thlorenz/cardinal/tree/master/themes) or the
full path to a custom theme anywhere on your computer.
- linenos toggles line number printing

## API

### *highlight(code[, opts])*

- returns the highlighted version of the passed code ({String}) or throws an error if it was not able to parse it
- opts (see below)

### *highlightFileSync(fullPath[, opts])*

- returns the highlighted version of the file whose fullPath ({String}) was passed or throws an error if it was not able
  to parse it
- opts (see below)

### *highlightFile(fullPath[, opts], callback)*

- calls back with the highlighted version of the file whose fullPath ({String}) was passed or with an error if it was not able
  to parse it
- opts (see below)
- `callback` ({Function}) has the following signature: `function (err, highlighted) { .. }`

### opts

opts is an {Object} with the following properties:

- `theme` {Object} is used to optionally override the theme used to highlight
- `linenos` {Boolean} if `true` line numbers are included in the highlighted code
- `firstline` {Integer} sets line number of the first line when line numbers are printed
- `json` {Boolean} if `true` highlights JSON in addition to JavaScript (`true` by default if file extension is `.json`)
