### v2.14.10 (2015-11-05):

There's nothing in here that that isn't in the `npm@3.4.0` release notes, but
all of the commit shasums have been adjusted to be correct. Enjoy!

#### BUG FIXES VIA DEPENDENCY UPDATES

  name of a scoped module's binary, it would install it such that it was
  impossible to call it.  ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

  ([@KenanY](https://github.com/KenanY))

### v2.14.9 (2015-10-29):

There's still life in `npm@2`, but for now, enjoy these dependency upgrades!
Also, [@othiym23](https://github.com/othiym23) says hi! _waves_
[@zkat](https://github.com/zkat) has her hands full, and
[@iarna](https://github.com/iarna)'s handling `npm@3`, so I'm dealing with
`npm@2` and the totally nonexistent weird bridge `npm@1.4` LTS release that may
or may not be happening this week.

### v2.14.8 (2015-10-08):

#### SLOWLY RECOVERING FROM FEELINGS

OS&F is definitely my favorite convention I've gone to. Y'all should check it
out next year! Rebecca and Kat are back, although Forrest is out at
[&yet conf](http://andyetconf.com/).

This week sees another tiny LTS release with non-code-related patches -- just
CI/release things.

Meanwhile, have you heard? `npm@3` is much faster now! Go upgrade with `npm
install -g npm@latest` and give it a whirl if you haven't already!

#### IF YOU CHANGE CASING ON A FILE, YOU ARE NOT MY FRIEND

Seriously. I love me some case-sensitive filesystems, but a lot of us have to
deal with `git` and its funky support for case normalizing systems. Have mercy
and just don't bother if all you're changing is casing, please? Otherwise, I
have to do this little dance to prevent horrible conflicts.

* [`c3a7b61`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/c3a7b619786650a45653c8b55b8741fc7bb5cfda)

  with desired casing.
  ([@zkat](https://github.com/zkat))

#### IDK. OUR CI DOESN'T EVEN FULLY WORK YET BUT SURE

Either way, it's nice to make sure we're running stuff on the latest Node. `4.2`
is getting released very soon, though (this week?), and that'll be the first
official LTS release!

* [`bd0b9ab`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/bd0b9ab6e60a31448794bbd88f94672572c3cb55)

  ([@JaKXz](https://github.com/JaKXz))

### v2.14.7 (2015-10-01):

#### MORE RELEASE STAGGERING?!

Hi all, and greetings from [Open Source & Feelings](http://osfeels.com)!

So we're switching gears a little with how we handle our weekly releases: from
now on, we're going to stagger release weeks between dependency bumps and
regular patches. So, this week, aside from a doc change, we'll be doing only
version bumps. Expect actual patches next week!

#### TOTALLY FOLLOWING THE RULES ALREADY

So I snuck this in, because it's our own [@snopeks](https://github.com/snopeks)'
first contribution to the main `npm` repo. She's been helping with building
support documents for Orgs, and contributed her general intro guide to the new
feature so you can read it with `npm help orgs` right in your terminal!

* [`8324ea0`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/8324ea023ace4e08b6b8959ad199e2457af9f9cf)
  [#9761](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/9761) Added general user guide for
  Orgs.
  ([@snopeks](https://github.com/snopeks))

#### JUST. ONE. MORE.

* [`9a502ca`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/9a502ca96e2d43ec75a8f684c9ca33af7e910f0a)
  Use unique package name in tests to work around weird test-state-based
  failures.
  ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

#### OKAY ACTUALLY THE THING I WAS SUPPOSED TO DO

Anyway -- here's your version bump! :)

  ([@pgte](https://github.com/pgte))

### v2.14.6 (2015-09-24):

#### `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

Since `2.x` is LTS now, you can expect a slowdown in overall release sizes. On
top of that, we had our all-company-npm-internal-conf thing on Monday and
Tuesday so there wasn't really time to do much at all.

Still, we're bringing you a couple of tiny little changes this week!

* [`7b7da13`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/7b7da13c6cdf5eae53c20d5c69afc4c16e6f715d)
  [#9471](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/9471) When the port for a tarball is
  different than the registry it's in, but the hostname is the same, the
  protocol is now allowed to change, too.

  `request@2.63.0`: Use `application/json` as the default content type when
  making `json` requests.
  ([@simov](https://github.com/simov))

### v2.14.5 (2015-09-17):

#### NPM IS DEAD. LONG LIVE NPM

That's right folks. As of this week, `npm@latest` is `npm@3`! There's some
really great shiny new things over there, and you should really take a look.

Many kudos to [@iarna](https://github.com/iarna) for her hard work on `npm@3`!

Don't worry, we'll keep `2.x` around for a while (as LTS), but you won't see
many, if any, new features on this end. From now on, we're going to use
`latest-2` and `next-2` as the dist tags for the `npm@2` branch.

#### OKAY THAT'S FINE CAN I DEPRECATE THINGS NOW?

Yes! Specially if you're using scoped packages. Apparently, deprecating them
never worked, but that should be better now. :)

* [`eca7b24`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/eca7b24de9a0090da02a93a69726f5e70ab80543)

  Fixes `npm deprecate` so you can actually deprecate scoped modules now (it
  never worked).
  ([@zkat](https://github.com/zkat))

#### WTF IS `node-waf`

idk. Some old thing. We don't talk about it anymore.

  `node-waf` in the docs to refer to the `node-gyp` version of things.
  ([@KenanY](https://github.com/KenanY))

#### THE `graceful-fs` AND `node-gyp` SAGA CONTINUES

Last week had some sweeping `graceful-fs` upgrades, and this takes care of one
of the stragglers, as well as bumping `node-gyp`. `node@4` users might be
excited about this, or even `node@<4` users who previously had to cherry-pick a
bunch of patches to get the latest npm working.

  ([@isaacs](https://github.com/isaacs))

### v2.14.4 (2015-09-10):

#### THE GREAT NODEv4 SAGA

So [Node 4 is out now](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v4.0.0/) and that's
going to involve a number of things over in npm land. Most importantly, it's the
last major release that will include the `2.x` branch of npm. That also means
that `2.x` is going to go into LTS mode in the coming weeks -- once `npm@3`
becomes our official `latest` release. You can most likely expect Node 5 to
include `npm@3` by default, whenever that happens. We'll go into more detail
about LTS at that point, as well, so keep your eyes peeled for announcements!

#### NODE IS DEAD. LONG LIVE NODE!

Node 4 being released means that a few things that used to be floating patches
are finally making it right into npm proper. This week, we've got two such
updates, both to dependencies:

* [`505d9e4`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/505d9e40c13b8b0bb3f70ee9886f7b73ba569407)
  `node-gyp@3.0.1`: Support for node nightlies and compilation for both node and
  io.js without extra patching
  ([@rvagg](https://github.com/rvagg))

[@thefourtheye](https://github.com/thefourtheye) was kind enough to submit a
*bunch* of PRs to npm's dependencies updating them to `graceful-fs@4.1.2`, which
mainly makes it so we're no longer monkey-patching `fs`. The following are all
updates related to this:

* [`10cb189`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/10cb189c773fef804214018d57509cc7a943184b)

### v2.14.3 (2015-09-03):

#### TEAMS AND ORGS STILL BETA. CLI CODE STILL SOLID.

Our closed beta for Teens and Orcs is happening! The web team is hard at work
making sure everything looks pretty and usable and such. Once we fix things
stemming from that beta, you can expect the feature to be available publicly.
Some time after that, it'll even be available for free for FOSS orgs. It'll Be
Done When It's Done™.

#### OH GOOD, I CAN ACTUALLY UPSTREAM NOW

Looks like last week's release foiled our own test suite when trying to upstream
it to Node! Just a friendly reminder that no, `.npmrc` is no longer included
then you pack/release a package! [@othiym23](https://github.com/othiym23) and
[@isaacs](https://github.com/isaacs) managed to suss the really strange test
failures resulting from that, and we've patched it in this release.

### v2.14.2 (2015-08-27):

#### GETTING THAT PESKY `preferGlobal` WARNING RIGHT

So apparently the `preferGlobal` option hasn't quite been warning correctly for
some time. But now it should be all better! tl;dr: if you try and install a
dependency with `preferGlobal: true`, and it's _not already_ in your
`package.json`, you'll get a warning that the author would really rather you
install it with `--global`. This should prevent Windows PowerShell from thinking
npm has failed just because of a benign warning.

### v2.14.1 (2015-08-20):

#### SECURITY FIX

There are patches for two information leaks of moderate severity in `npm@2.14.1`:

1. In some cases, npm was leaking sensitive credential information into the
   child environment when running package and lifecycle scripts. This could
   lead to packages being published with files (most notably `config.gypi`, a
   file created by `node-gyp` that is a cache of environmental information
   regenerated on every run) containing the bearer tokens used to authenticate
   users to the registry. Users with affected packages have been notified (and
   the affected tokens invalidated), and now npm has been modified to not
   upload files that could contain this information, as well as scrubbing the
   sensitive information out of the environment passed to child scripts.
2. Per-package `.npmrc` files are used by some maintainers as a way to scope
   those packages to a specific registry and its credentials. This is a
   reasonable use case, but by default `.npmrc` was packed into packages,
   leaking those credentials.  npm will no longer include `.npmrc` when packing
   tarballs.

If you maintain packages and believe you may be affected by either
of the above scenarios (especially if you've received a security
notification from npm recently), please upgrade to `npm@2.14.1` as
soon as possible. If you believe you may have inadvertently leaked
your credentials, upgrade to `npm@2.14.1` on the affected machine,
and run `npm logout` and then `npm login`. Your access tokens will be
invalidated, which will eliminate any risk posed by tokens inadvertently
included in published packages. We apologize for the inconvenience this
causes, as well as the oversight that led to the existence of this issue
in the first place.

Huge thanks to [@ChALkeR](https://github.com/ChALkeR) for bringing these
issues to our attention, and for helping us identify affected packages
and maintainers. Thanks also to the Node.js security working group for
their coördination with the team in our response to this issue. We
appreciate everybody's patience and understanding tremendously.

### v2.14.0 (2015-08-13):

#### IT'S HERE! KINDA!

This release adds support for teens and orcs (err, teams and organizations) to
the npm CLI! Note that the web site and registry-side features of this are
still not ready for public consumption.

A beta should be starting in the next couple of weeks, and the features
themselves will become public once all that's done. Keep an eye out for more
news!

### v2.13.5 (2015-08-07):

This is another quiet week for the `npm@2` release.
[@zkat](https://github.com/zkat) has been working hard on polishing the CLI
bits of the registry's new feature to support direct management of teams and
organizations, and [@iarna](https://github.com/iarna) continues to work through
the list of issues blocking the general release of `npm@3`, which is looking
more and more solid all the time.

[@othiym23](https://github.com/othiym23) and [@zkat](https://github.com/zkat)
have also been at this week's Node.js / io.js [collaborator
summit](https://github.com/nodejs/summit/tree/master), both as facilitators and
participants. This is a valuable opportunity to get some face time with other
contributors and to work through a bunch of important discussions, but it does
leave us feeling kind of sleepy. Running meetings is hard!

What does that leave for this release? A few of the more tricky bug fixes that
have been sitting around for a little while now, and a couple dependency
upgrades. Nothing too fancy, but most of these were contributed by developers
like _you_, which we think is swell. Thanks!

### v2.13.2 (2015-07-16):

#### HOLD ON TO YOUR TENTACLES... IT'S NPM RELEASE TIME!

Kat: Hooray! Full team again, and we've got a pretty small patch  release this
week, about everyone's favorite recurring issue: git URLs!

Rebecca: No Way! Again?

Kat: The ride never ends! In the meantime, there's some fun, exciting work in
the background to get orgs and teams out the door. Keep an eye out for news. :)

Rebecca: And make sure to keep an eye out for patches for the super-fresh
`npm@3`!

#### LET'S GIT INKY

Rebecca: So what's this about another git URL issue?

Kat: Welp, I apparently broke backwards-compatibility on what are actually
invalid `git+https` URLs! So I'm making it work, but we're gonna deprecate URLs
that look like `git+https://user@host:path/is/here`.

Rebecca: What should we use instead?!

Kat: Just do me a solid and use `git+ssh://user@host:path/here` or
`git+https://user@host/absolute/https/path` instead!

### v2.13.0 (2015-07-02):

#### FORREST IS OUT! LET'S SNEAK IN ALL THE THINGS!

Well, not _everything_. Just a couple of goodies, like the new `npm ping`
command, and the ability to add files to the commits created by `npm version`
with the new version hooks. There's also a couple of bugfixes in `npm` itself
and some of its dependencies. Here we go!

#### YES HELLO THIS IS NPM REGISTRY SORRY NO DOG HERE

Yes, that's right! We now have a dedicated `npm ping` command. It's super simple
and super easy. You ping. We tell you whether you pinged right by saying hello
right back. This should help out folks dealing with things like proxy issues or
other registry-access debugging issues. Give it a shot!

This addresses [#5750](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/5750), and will help
with the `npm doctor` stuff described in
[#6756](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/6756).

#### I'VE WANTED THIS FOR `version` SINCE LIKE LITERALLY FOREVER AND A DAY

Seriously! This patch lets you add files to the `version` commit before it's
made, So you can add additional metadata files, more automated changes to
`package.json`, or even generate `CHANGELOG.md` automatically pre-commit if
you're into that sort of thing. I'm so happy this is there I can't even. Do you
have other fun usecases for this? Tell

trying to install packages with a bunch of dependencies. Isaac patched up
[`graceful-fs`](https://github.com/isaacs/node-graceful-fs) to handle this case
better, so we should be seeing fewer of those.

### v2.12.1 (2015-06-25):

#### HEY WHERE DID EVERYBODY GO

I keep [hearing some commotion](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v3.0.0).
Is there something going on? Like, a party or something? Anyway, here's a small
release with at least two significant bug fixes, at least one of which some of
you have been waiting for for quite a while.

#### REMEMBER WHEN I SAID "REMEMBER WHEN I SAID THAT THING ABOUT PERMISSIONS?"?

`npm@2.12.0` has a change that introduces a fix for a permissions problem
whereby the `_locks` directory in the cache directory can up being owned by
root. The fix in 2.12.0 takes care of that problem, but introduces a new
problem for Windows users where npm tries to call `process.getuid()`, which
doesn't exist on Windows. It was easy enough to fix (but more or less
impossible to test, thanks to all the external dependencies involved with
permissions and platforms and whatnot), but as a result, Windows users might
want to skip `npm@2.12.0` and go straight to `npm@2.12.1`. Sorry about that!

* [`7e5da23`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/7e5da238ee869201fdb9027c27b79b0f76b440a8)
  When using the new, "fixed" cache directory creator, be extra-careful to not
  call `process.getuid()` on platforms that lack it.
  ([@othiym23](https://github.com/othiym23))

#### WHEW! ALL DONE FIXING GIT FOREVER!

New npm CLI team hero [@zkat](https://github.com/zkat) has finally (FINALLY)
fixed the regression somebody (hi!) introduced a couple months ago whereby git
URLs of the format `git+ssh://user@githost.com:org/repo.git` suddenly stopped
working, and also started being saved (and cached) incorrectly. I am 100% sure
there are absolutely no more bugs in the git caching code at all ever. Mm hm.
Yep. Pretty sure. Maybe. Hmm... I hope.

### v2.12.0 (2015-06-18):

#### REMEMBER WHEN I SAID THAT THING ABOUT PERMISSIONS?

About [a million people](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+EACCES+_locks)
have filed issues related to having a tough time using npm after they've run
npm once or twice with sudo. "Don't worry about it!" I said. "We've fixed all
those permissions problems ages ago! Use this one weird trick and you'll never
have to deal with this again!"

Well, uh, if you run npm with root the first time you run npm on a machine, it
turns out that the directory npm uses to store lockfiles ends up being owned by
the wrong user (almost always root), and that can, well, it can cause problems
sometimes. By which I mean every time you run npm without being root it'll barf
with `EACCES` errors. Whoops!

This is an obnoxious regression, and to prevent it from recurring, we've made
it so that the cache, cached git remotes, and the lockfile directories are all
created and maintained using the same utilty module, which not only creates the
relevant paths with the correct permissions, but will fix the permissions on
those directories (if it can) when it notices that they're broken. An `npm
install` run as root ought to be sufficient to fix things up (and if that
doesn't work, first tell us about it, and then run `sudo chown -R $(whoami)
$HOME/.npm`)

Also, I apologize for inadvertently gaslighting any of you by claiming this bug
wasn't actually a bug. I do think we've got this permanently dealt with now,
but I'll be paying extra-close attention to permissions issues related to the
cache for a while.

* [`85d1a53`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/85d1a53d7b5e0fc04823187e522ae3711ede61fa)
  Set permissions on lock directory to the owner of the process.

#### I WENT TO NODECONF AND ALL I GOT WAS THIS LOUSY SPDX T-SHIRT

That's not literally true. We spent very little time discussing SPDX,
[@kemitchell](https://github.com/kemitchell) is a champ, and I had a lot of fun
playing drum & bass to a mostly empty Boogie Barn and only ended up with one
moderately severe cold for my pains. Another winner of a NodeConf! (I would
probably wear a SPDX T-shirt if somebody gave me one, though.)

A bunch of us did have a spirited discussion of the basics of open-source
intellectual property, and the convergence of me,
[@kemitchell](https://github.com/kemitchell), and
[@jandrieu](https://github.com/jandrieu) in one place allowed us to hammmer out
a small but significant issue that had been bedeviling early adopters of the
new SPDX expression syntax in `package.json` license fields: how to deal with
packages that are left without a license on purpose.

Refer to [the docs](https://github.com/npm/npm/blob/16a3dd545b10f8a2464e2037506ce39124739b41/doc/files/package.json.md#license)
for the specifics, but the short version is that instead of using
`LicenseRef-LICENSE` for proprietary licenses, you can now use either
`UNLICENSED` if you want to make it clear that you don't _want_ your software
to be licensed (and want npm to stop warning you about this), or `SEE LICENSE
IN <filename>` if there's a license with custom text you want to use. At some
point in the near term, we'll be updating npm to verify that the mentioned
file actually exists, but for now you're all on the honor system.

### v2.11.2 (2015-06-04):

Another small release this week, brought to you by the latest addition to the
CLI team, [@zkat](https://github.com/zkat) (Hi, all!)

Mostly small documentation tweaks and version updates. Oh! And `npm outdated`
is actually sorted now. Rejoice!

It's gonna be a while before we get another palindromic version number. Enjoy it
while it lasts. :3

#### QUALITY OF LIFE HAS NEVER BEEN BETTER

* [`31aada4`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/31aada4ccc369c0903ff7f233f464955d12c6fe2)
  [#8401](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/8401) `npm outdated` output is just
  that much nicer to consume now, due to sorting by name.

* [`55d6d71`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/55d6d71562e979e745c9db88861cc39f99b9f3ec)
  Ensure package name and version are included in display during `npm version`
  lifecycle execution. Gets rid of those little `undefined`s in the console.
  ([@othiym23](https://github.com/othiym23))

#### WORDS HAVE NEVER BEEN QUITE THIS READABLE

* [`3901e49`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/3901e4974c800e7f9fba4a5b2ff88da1126d5ef8)

### v2.11.1 (2015-05-28):

JSConf 2015, which is why it's so tiny.

#### CONFERENCE WIFI CAN'T STOP THESE BUG FIXES

* [`cf109a6`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/cf109a682f38a059a994da953d5c1b4aaece5e2f)
  [#8381](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/8381) Documented a subtle gotcha
  with `.npmrc`, which is that it needs to have its permissions set such that
  only the owner can read or write the file.
  ([@colakong](https://github.com/colakong))
* [`180da67`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/180da67c9fa53103d625e2f031626c2453c7ebcd)

  `GIT_SSH_COMMAND`, which allows you to pass an explicit git command (with,
  for example, a specific identity passed in on the command line).
    ([@nmalaguti](https://github.com/nmalaguti))

#### MY (VIRGIN) PINA COLADA IS GETTING LOW, BETTER UPGRADE THESE DEPENDENCIES

* [`b72de41`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/b72de41c5cc9f0c46d3fa8f062c75bd273641474)
  `node-gyp@2.0.0`: Use a newer version of `gyp`, and generally improve support
  for Visual Studios and Windows.

* [`7333701`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/7333701b5d4f01673f37d64992c63c4e15864d6d)
  `request@2.56.0`: Bug fixes and dependency upgrades.
  ([@simov](https://github.com/simov))

### v2.11.0 (2015-05-21):

For the first time in a very long time, we've added new events to the life
cycle used by `npm run-script`. Since running `npm version (major|minor|patch)`
is typically the last thing many developers do before publishing their updated
packages, it makes sense to add life cycle hooks to run tests or otherwise
preflight the package before doing a full publish. Thanks, as always, to the
indefatigable [@watilde](https://github.com/watilde) for yet another great
usability improvement for npm!

#### FEATURELETS

* [`b07f7c7`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/b07f7c7c1e5021730b3c320f1b3a46e70f8a21ff)
  [#7906](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/7906)
  Add new [`scripts`](https://github.com/npm/npm/blob/master/doc/misc/npm-scripts.md) to
  allow you to run scripts before and after
  the [`npm version`](https://github.com/npm/npm/blob/master/doc/cli/npm-version.md)
  command has run. This makes it easy to, for instance, require that your
  test suite passes before bumping the version by just adding `"preversion":
  "npm test"` to the scripts section of your `package.json`.
  ([@watilde](https://github.com/watilde))
* [`8a46136`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/8a46136f42e416cbadb533bcf89d73d681ed421d)
  [#8185](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/8185)
  When we get a "not found" error from the registry, we'll now check to see
  if the package name you specified is invalid and if so, give you a better
  error message. ([@thefourtheye](https://github.com/thefourtheye))

#### BUG FIXES

* [`9bcf573`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/9bcf5730bd0316f210dafea898afe9103849cea9)
  [#8324](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/8324) On Windows, when you've configured a
  custom `node-gyp`, run it with node itself instead of using the default open action (which
  is almost never what you want). ([@bangbang93](https://github.com/bangbang93))
* [`1da9b04`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/1da9b0411d3416c7fca17d08cbbcfca7ae86e92d)
  [#7195](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/7195)

### v2.10.0 (2015-05-8):

#### THE IMPLICATIONS ARE MORE PROFOUND THAN THEY APPEAR

If you've done much development in The Enterprise®™, you know that keeping
track of software licenses is far more important than one might expect / hope /
fear. Tracking licenses is a hassle, and while many (if not most) of us have
(reluctantly) gotten around to setting a license to use by default with all our
new projects (even if it's just WTFPL), that's about as far as most of us think
about it. In big enterprise shops, ensuring that projects don't inadvertently
use software with unacceptably encumbered licenses is serious business, and
developers spend a surprising (and appalling) amount of time ensuring that
licensing is covered by writing automated checkers and other license auditing
tools.

The Linux Foundation has been working on a machine-parseable syntax for license
expressions in the form of [SPDX](https://spdx.org/), an appropriately
enterprisey acronym. IP attorney and JavaScript culture hero [Kyle
Mitchell](http://kemitchell.com/) has put a considerable amount of effort into
bringing SPDX to JavaScript and Node. He's written
[`spdx.js`](https://github.com/kemitchell/spdx.js), a JavaScript SPDX
expression parser, and has integrated it into npm in a few different ways.

For you as a user of npm, this means:

* npm now has proper support for dual licensing in `package.json`, due to
  SPDX's compound expression syntax. Run `npm help package.json` for details.
* npm will warn you if the `package.json` for your project is either missing a
  `"license"` field, or if the value of that field isn't a valid SPDX
  expression (pro tip: `"BSD"` becomes `"BSD-2-Clause"` in SPDX (unless you
  really want one of its variants); `"MIT"` and `"ISC"` are fine as-is; the
  [full list](https://github.com/shinnn/spdx-license-ids/blob/master/spdx-license-ids.json)
  is its own package).
* `npm init` now demands that you use a valid SPDX expression when using it
  interactively (pro tip: I mostly use `npm init -y`, having previously run
  `npm config set init.license=MIT` / `npm config set init.author.email=foo` /
  `npm config set init.author.name=me`).
* The documentation for `package.json` has been updated to tell you how to use
  the `"license"` field properly with SPDX.

In general, this shouldn't be a big deal for anybody other than people trying
to run their own automated license validators, but in the long run, if
everybody switches to this format, many people's lives will be made much
simpler. I think this is an important improvement for npm and am very thankful
to Kyle for taking the lead on this. Also, even if you think all of this is
completely stupid, just [choose a license](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License-free_software)
anyway. Future you will thank past you someday, unless you are
[djb](http://cr.yp.to/), in which case you are djb, and more power to you.

  ([@othiym23](https://github.com/othiym23))

As a corollary to the previous changes, I've put some work into making `npm
install` spew out fewer pointless warnings about missing values in transitive
dependencies. From now on, npm will only warn you about missing READMEs,
license fields, and the like for top-level projects (including packages you
directly install into your application, but we may relax that eventually).

Practically _nobody_ liked having those warnings displayed for child
dependencies, for the simple reason that there was very little that anybody
could _do_ about those warnings, unless they happened to be the maintainers of
those dependencies themselves. Since many, many projects don't have
SPDX-compliant licenses, the number of warnings reached a level where they ran
the risk of turning into a block of visual noise that developers (read: me, and
probably you) would ignore forever.

So I fixed it. If you still want to see the messages about child dependencies,
they're still there, but have been pushed down a logging level to `info`. You
can display them by running `npm install -d` or `npm install --loglevel=info`.

### v2.9.1 (2015-04-30):

#### WOW! MORE GIT FIXES! YOU LOVE THOSE!

The first item below is actually a pretty big deal, as it fixes (with a
one-word change and a much, much longer test case (thanks again,
[@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))) a regression that's been around for months
now. If you're depending on multiple branches of a single git dependency in a
single project, you probably want to check out `npm@2.9.1` and verify that
things (again?) work correctly in your project.

#### DOCUMENTATION FIXES AND TWEAKS

These changes may seem simple and small (except Lin's fix to the package name
restrictions, which was more an egregious oversight on our part), but cleaner
documentation makes npm significantly more pleasant to use. I really appreciate
all the typo fixes, clarifications, and formatting tweaks people send us, and
am delighted that we get so many of these pull requests. Thanks, everybody!

  take with us to our graves the reasons why the maximum package name length is 214

### v2.9.0 (2015-04-23):

This week was kind of a breather to concentrate on fixing up the tests on the
`multi-stage` branch, and not mess with git issues for a little while.
Unfortunately, There are now enough severe git issues that we'll probably have
to spend another couple weeks tackling them. In the meantime, enjoy these two
small features. They're just enough to qualify for a semver-minor bump:

#### NANOFEATURES

### v2.8.3 (2015-04-15):

#### TWO SMALL GIT TWEAKS

This is the last of a set of releases intended to ensure npm's git support is
robust enough that we can stop working on it for a while. These fixes are
small, but prevent a common crasher and clear up one of the more confusing
error messages coming out of npm when working with repositories hosted on git.

* [`387f889`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/387f889c0e8fb617d9cc9a42ed0a3ec49424ab5d)

  confusing error message. ([@othiym23](https://github.com/othiym23))

### v2.8.2 (2015-04-14):

#### PEACE IN OUR TIME

npm has been having an issue with CouchDB's web server since the release
of io.js and Node.js 0.12.0 that has consumed a huge amount of my time
to little visible effect. Sam Mikes picked up the thread from me, and
after a [_lot_ of effort](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/7699#issuecomment-93091111)
figured out that ultimately there are probably a couple problems with
the new HTTP Agent keep-alive handling in new versions of Node. In
addition, `npm-registry-client` was gratuitously sending a body along
with a GET request which was triggering the bugs. Sam removed about 10 bytes from
one file in `npm-registry-client`, and this problem, which has been bugging us for months,
completely went away.

In conclusion, Sam Mikes is great, and anybody using a private registry
hosted on CouchDB should thank him for his hard work. Also, thanks to
the community at large for pitching in on this bug, which has been
around for months now.

### v2.8.1 (2015-04-12):

#### CORRECTION: NPM'S GIT INTEGRATION IS DOING OKAY

A [helpful bug report](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/7872#issuecomment-91809553)
led to another round of changes to
[`hosted-git-info`](https://github.com/npm/hosted-git-info/commit/827163c74531b69985d1ede7abced4861e7b0cd4),
some additional test-writing, and a bunch of hands-on testing against actual
private repositories. While the complexity of npm's git dependency handling is
nearly fractal (because npm is very complex, and git is even more complex),
it's feeling way more solid than it has for a while. We think this is a
substantial improvement over what we had before, so give `npm@2.8.1` a shot if
you have particularly complex git use cases and
[let us know](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/new) how it goes.

(NOTE: These changes mostly affect cloning and saving references to packages
hosted in git repositories, and don't address some known issues with things
like lifecycle scripts not being run on npm dependencies. Work continues on
other issues that affect parity between git and npm registry packages.)

#### SCOPED DEPENDENCIES AND PEER DEPENDENCIES: NOT QUITE REESE'S

Big thanks to [@ewie](https://github.com/ewie) for identifying an issue with
how npm was handling `peerDependencies` that were implicitly installed from the
`package.json` files of scoped dependencies. This
[will be a moot point](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/6565#issuecomment-74971689)
with the release of `npm@3`, but until then, it's important that
`peerDependency` auto-installation work as expected.

#### MAKING IT EASIER TO WRITE NPM TESTS, VERSION 0.0.1

[@iarna](https://github.com/iarna) and I
([@othiym23](https://github.com/othiym23)) have been discussing a
[candidate plan](https://github.com/npm/npm/wiki/rewriting-npm's-tests:-a-plan-maybe)
for improving npm's test suite, with the goal of making it easier for new
contributors to get involved with npm by reducing the learning curve
necessary to be able to write good tests for proposed changes. This is the
first substantial piece of that effort. Here's what the commit message for
[`ed7e249`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/ed7e249d50444312cd266942ce3b89e1ca049bdf)
had to say about this work:

> It's too difficult for npm contributors to figure out what the conventional
> style is for tests. Part of the problem is that the documentation in
> CONTRIBUTING.md is inadequate, but another important factor is that the tests
> themselves are written in a variety of styles.  One of the most notable
> examples of this is the fact that many tests use fixture directories to store
> precooked test scenarios and package.json files.
>
> This had some negative consequences:
>
>   * tests weren't idempotent
>   * subtle dependencies between tests existed
>   * new tests get written in this deprecated style because it's not
>     obvious that the style is out of favor
>   * it's hard to figure out why a lot of those directories existed,
>     because they served a variety of purposes, so it was difficult to
>     tell when it was safe to remove them
>
> All in all, the fixture directories were a major source of technical debt, and
> cleaning them up, while time-consuming, makes the whole test suite much more
> approachable, and makes it more likely that new tests written by outside
> contributors will follow a conventional style. To support that, all of the
> tests touched by this changed were cleaned up to pass the `standard` style
> checker.

And here's a little extra context from a comment I left on [#7929](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/7929):

> One of the other things that encouraged me was looking at this
> [presentation on technical debt](http://www.slideshare.net/nnja/pycon-2015-technical-debt-the-monster-in-your-closet)
> from Pycon 2015, especially slide 53, which I interpreted in terms of
> difficulty getting new contributors to submit patches to an OSS project like
> npm. npm has a long ways to go, but I feel good about this change.

### v2.8.0 (2015-04-09):

#### WE WILL NEVER BE DONE FIXING NPM'S GIT SUPPORT

If you look at [the last release's release
notes](https://github.com/npm/npm/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#git-mean-git-tuff-git-all-the-way-away-from-my-stuff),
you will note that they confidently assert that it's perfectly OK to force all
GitHub URLs through the same `git:` -> `git+ssh:` fallback flow for cloning. It
turns out that many users depend on `git+https:` URLs in their build
environments because they use GitHub auth tokens instead of SSH keys. Also, in
some cases you just want to be able to explicitly say how a given dependency
should be cloned from GitHub.

Because of the way we resolved the inconsistency in GitHub shorthand handling
[before](https://github.com/npm/npm/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#bug-fixes-1), this
turned out to be difficult to work around. So instead of hacking around it, we
completely redid how git is handled within npm and its attendant packages.
Again. This time, we changed things so that `normalize-package-data` and
`read-package-json` leave more of the git logic to npm itself, which makes
handling shorthand syntax consistently much easier, and also allows users to
resume using explicit, fully-qualified git URLs without npm messing with them.

Here's a summary of what's changed:

* Instead of converting the GitHub shorthand syntax to a `git+ssh:`, `git:`, or
  `git+https:` URL and saving that, save the shorthand itself to
  `package.json`.
* If presented with shortcuts, try cloning via the git protocol, SSH, and HTTPS
  (in that order).
* No longer prompt for credentials -- it didn't work right with the spinner,
  and wasn't guaranteed to work anyway. We may experiment with doing this a
  better way in the future. Users can override this by setting `GIT_ASKPASS` in
  their environment if they want to experiment with interactive cloning, but
  should also set `--no-spin` on the npm command line (or run `npm config set
  spin=false`).
* **EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE**: Add support for `github:`, `gist:`, `bitbucket:`,
  and `gitlab:` shorthand prefixes. GitHub shortcuts will continue to be
  normalized to `org/repo` instead of being saved as `github:org/repo`, but
  `gitlab:`, `gist:`, and `bitbucket:` prefixes will be used on the command
  line and from `package.json`. BE CAREFUL WITH THIS. `package.json` files
  published with the new shorthand syntax can _only_ be read by `npm@2.8.0` and
  later, and this feature is mostly meant for playing around with it. If you
  want to save git dependencies in a form that older versions of npm can read,
  use `--save-exact`, which will save the git URL and resolved commit hash of
  the head of the branch in a manner similar to the way that `--save-exact`
  pins versions for registry dependencies.  This is documented (so check `npm
  help install` for details), but we're not going to make a lot of noise about
  it until it has a chance to bake in a little more.

It is [@othiym23](https://github.com/othiym23)'s sincere hope that this will
resolve all of the inconsistencies users were seeing with GitHub and git-hosted
packages, but given the level of change here, that may just be a fond wish.
Extra testing of this change is requested.

### v2.7.6 (2015-04-02):

#### GIT MEAN, GIT TUFF, GIT ALL THE WAY AWAY FROM MY STUFF

Part of the reason that we're reluctant to take patches to how npm deals with
git dependencies is that every time we touch the git support, something breaks.
The last few releases are a case in point. `npm@2.7.4` completely broke
installing private modules from GitHub, and `npm@2.7.5` fixed them at the cost
of logging a misleading error message that caused many people to believe that
their dependencies hadn't been successfully installed when they actually had
been.

This all started from a desire to ensure that GitHub shortcut syntax is being
handled correctly.  The correct behavior is for npm to try to clone all
dependencies on GitHub (whether they're specified with the GitHub
`organization/repository` shortcut syntax or not) via the plain `git:` protocol
first, and to fall back to using `git+ssh:` if `git:` doesn't work. Previously,
sometimes npm would use `git:` and `git+ssh:` in some cases (most notably when
using GitHub shortcut syntax on the command line), and use `git+https:` in
others (when the GitHub shortcut syntax was present in `package.json`). This
led to subtle and hard-to-understand inconsistencies, and we're glad that as of
`npm@2.7.6`, we've finally gotten things to where they were before we started,
only slightly more consistent overall.

We are now going to go back to our policy of being extremely reluctant to touch
the code that handles Git dependencies.

  `tar@2.0.0`: Normalize symbolic links that point to targets outside the
  extraction root. This prevents packages containing symbolic links from
  overwriting targets outside the expected paths for a package. Thanks to [Tim
  Cuthbertson](http://gfxmonk.net/) and the team at [Lift

  This prevents a situation in which parsing the version number can use
  exponentially more time and memory to parse, leading to a potential denial of
  service. Thanks to Adam Baldwin at Lift Security for bringing this to our
  attention.  ([@isaacs](https://github.com/isaacs))

### v2.7.0 (2015-02-26):

#### SOMETIMES SEMVER MEANS "SUBJECTIVE-EMPATHETIC VERSIONING"

For a very long time (maybe forever?), the documentation for `npm run-script`
has said that `npm restart` will only call `npm stop` and `npm start` when
there is no command defined as `npm restart` in `package.json`. The problem
with this documentation is that `npm run-script` was apparently never wired up
to actually work this way.

Until now.

If the patch below were landed on its own, free of context, it would be a
breaking change. But, since the "new" behavior is how the documentation claims
this feature has always worked, I'm classifying it as a patch-level bug fix. I
apologize in advance if this breaks anybody's deployment scripts, and if it
turns out to be a significant regression in practice, we can revert this change
and move it to `npm@3`, which is allowed to make breaking changes due to being
a new major version of semver.

* [`2f6a1df`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/2f6a1df3e1e3e0a3bc4abb69e40f59a64204e7aa)
  [#1999](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/1999) Only run `stop` and `start`
  scripts (plus their pre- and post- scripts) when there's no `restart` script
  defined. This makes it easier to support graceful restarts of services
  managed by npm.  ([@watilde](https://github.com/watilde) /
  [@scien](https://github.com/scien))

#### A SMALL FEATURE WITH BIG IMPLICATIONS

* [`145af65`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/145af6587f45de135cc876be2027ed818ed4ca6a)

  `node-gyp` script bundled with npm by passing the

  of `node-gyp` modified to work better with io.js without having to touch
  npm's code!  ([@ackalker](https://github.com/ackalker))

#### [@WATILDE'S](https://github.com/watilde) NPM USABILITY CORNER

Following `npm@2.6.1`'s unexpected fix of many of the issues with `npm update
-g` simply by making `--depth=0` the default for `npm outdated`, friend of npm

behavior that together justify bumping npm's minor version, as well as making
npm significantly more pleasant to use:

### v2.5.1 (2015-02-06):

This release doesn't look like much, but considerable effort went into ensuring
that npm's tests will pass on io.js 1.1.0 and Node 0.11.16 / 0.12.0 on both OS
X and Linux.

**NOTE:** there are no actual changes to npm's code in `npm@2.5.1`. Only test
code (and the upgrade of `request` to the latest version) has changed.

#### REGISTRY 2: ACCESS AND DIST-TAGS

NOTE: This week's registry-2 commands are leading the implementation on
registry.npmjs.org a little bit, so some of the following may not work for
another week or so. Also note that `npm access` has documentation and
subcommands that are not yet finished, because they depend on incompletely
specified registry API endpoints. Things are coming together very quickly,
though, so expect the missing pieces to be filled in the coming weeks.

### v1.3.20 (2013-12-17):

* Fixes a critical bug in v1.3.19.  Thankfully, due to that bug, no one could
  install npm v1.3.19 :)

### v1.3.19 (2013-12-16):

* Adds atomic PUTs for publishing packages, which should result in far fewer
  requests and less room for replication errors on the server-side.

### v1.3.18 (2013-12-16):

* Added an `--ignore-scripts` option, which will prevent `package.json` scripts
  from being run. Most notably, this will work on `npm install`, so e.g. `npm
  install --ignore-scripts` will not run preinstall and prepublish scripts.

### v1.3.17 (2013-12-11):

* This release reverts
  [`644c2ff`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/644c2ff3e3d9c93764f7045762477f48864d64a7),
  which avoided re-downloading URL and shinkwrap dependencies when doing `npm
  install`. You can see the in-depth reasoning in
  [`d8c907e`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/d8c907edc2019b75cff0f53467e34e0ffd7e5fba);
  the problem was, that the patch changed the behavior of `npm install -f` to
  reinstall all dependencies.
* A new version of the no-re-downloading fix has been submitted as
  [#4303](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/4303) and will hopefully be
  included in the next release.

### v1.3.16 (2013-12-11):

* Git URL dependencies are now updated on `npm install`, fixing a two-year old
  bug

  reducing the resulting Git-related I/O is tracked as

  big improvement.
* Added a `--json` mode to `npm outdated` to give a parseable output.

* Added a `--no-git-tag-version` option to `npm version`, for doing the usual
  job of `npm version` minus the Git tagging. This could be useful if you need
  to increase the version in other related files before actually adding the
  tag.

  force re-download and installation of all dependencies.
