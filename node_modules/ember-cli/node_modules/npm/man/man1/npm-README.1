.SH "NAME"
\fBnpm\fR \- a JavaScript package manager
.P
Build Status \fIhttps://img\.shields\.io/travis/npm/npm/master\.svg\fR \fIhttps://travis\-ci\.org/npm/npm\fR
.SH SYNOPSIS
.P
This is just enough info to get you up and running\.
.P
Much more info available via \fBnpm help\fP once it's installed\.
.SH IMPORTANT
.P
\fBYou need node v0\.8 or higher to run this program\.\fR
.P
To install an old \fBand unsupported\fR version of npm that works on node 0\.3
and prior, clone the git repo and dig through the old tags and branches\.
.SH Super Easy Install
.P
npm is bundled with node \fIhttp://nodejs\.org/download/\fR\|\.
.SS Windows Computers
.P
Get the MSI \fIhttp://nodejs\.org/download/\fR\|\.  npm is in it\.
.SS Apple Macintosh Computers
.P
Get the pkg \fIhttp://nodejs\.org/download/\fR\|\.  npm is in it\.
.SS Other Sorts of Unices
.P
Run \fBmake install\fP\|\.  npm will be installed with node\.
.P
If you want a more fancy pants install (a different version, customized
paths, etc\.) then read on\.
.SH Fancy Install (Unix)
.P
There's a pretty robust install script at
https://www\.npmjs\.com/install\.sh\|\.  You can download that and run it\.
.P
Here's an example using curl:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
curl \-L https://www\.npmjs\.com/install\.sh | sh
.fi
.RE
.SS Slightly Fancier
.P
You can set any npm configuration params with that script:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
npm_config_prefix=/some/path sh install\.sh
.fi
.RE
.P
Or, you can run it in uber\-debuggery mode:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
npm_debug=1 sh install\.sh
.fi
.RE
.SS Even Fancier
.P
Get the code with git\.  Use \fBmake\fP to build the docs and do other stuff\.
If you plan on hacking on npm, \fBmake link\fP is your friend\.
.P
If you've got the npm source code, you can also semi\-permanently set
arbitrary config keys using the \fB\|\./configure \-\-key=val \.\.\.\fP, and then
run npm commands by doing \fBnode cli\.js <cmd> <args>\fP\|\.  (This is helpful
for testing, or running stuff without actually installing npm itself\.)
.SH Windows Install or Upgrade
.P
You can download a zip file from https://github\.com/npm/npm/releases, and
unpack it in the \fBnode_modules\\npm\\\fP folder inside node's installation folder\.
.P
To upgrade to npm 2, follow the Windows upgrade instructions in
the npm Troubleshooting Guide:
.P
https://github\.com/npm/npm/wiki/Troubleshooting#upgrading\-on\-windows
.P
If that's not fancy enough for you, then you can fetch the code with
git, and mess with it directly\.
.SH Installing on Cygwin
.P
No\.
.SH Uninstalling
.P
So sad to see you go\.
.P
.RS 2
.nf
sudo npm uninstall npm \-g
.fi
.RE
.P
Or, if that fails,
.P
.RS 2
.nf
sudo make uninstall
.fi
.RE
.SH More Severe Uninstalling
.P
Usually, the above instructions are sufficient\.  That will remove
npm, but leave behind anything you've installed\.
.P
If you would like to remove all the packages that you have installed,
then you can use the \fBnpm ls\fP command to find them, and then \fBnpm rm\fP to
remove them\.
.P
To remove cruft left behind by npm 0\.x, you can use the included
\fBclean\-old\.sh\fP script file\.  You can run it conveniently like this:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
npm explore npm \-g \-\- sh scripts/clean\-old\.sh
.fi
.RE
.P
npm uses two configuration files, one for per\-user configs, and another
for global (every\-user) configs\.  You can view them by doing:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
npm config get userconfig   # defaults to ~/\.npmrc
npm config get globalconfig # defaults to /usr/local/etc/npmrc
.fi
.RE
.P
Uninstalling npm does not remove configuration files by default\.  You
must remove them yourself manually if you want them gone\.  Note that
this means that future npm installs will not remember the settings that
you have chosen\.
.SH Using npm Programmatically
.P
Although npm can be used programmatically, its API is meant for use by the CLI
\fIonly\fR, and no guarantees are made regarding its fitness for any other purpose\.
If you want to use npm to reliably perform some task, the safest thing to do is
to invoke the desired \fBnpm\fP command with appropriate arguments\.
.P
The semantic version of npm refers to the CLI itself, rather than the
underlying API\. \fIThe internal API is not guaranteed to remain stable even when
npm's version indicates no breaking changes have been made according to
semver\.\fR
.P
If you \fIstill\fR would like to use npm programmatically, it's \fIpossible\fR\|\. The API
isn't very well documented, but it \fIis\fR rather simple\.
.P
Eventually, npm will be just a thin CLI wrapper around the modules that it
depends on, but for now, there are some things that only the CLI can do\. You
should try using one of npm's dependencies first, and only use the API if what
you're trying to do is only supported by npm itself\.
.P
.RS 2
.nf
var npm = require("npm")
npm\.load(myConfigObject, function (er) {
  if (er) return handlError(er)
  npm\.commands\.install(["some", "args"], function (er, data) {
    if (er) return commandFailed(er)
    // command succeeded, and data might have some info
  })
  npm\.registry\.log\.on("log", function (message) { \.\.\.\. })
})
.fi
.RE
.P
The \fBload\fP function takes an object hash of the command\-line configs\.
The various \fBnpm\.commands\.<cmd>\fP functions take an \fBarray\fR of
positional argument \fBstrings\fR\|\.  The last argument to any
\fBnpm\.commands\.<cmd>\fP function is a callback\.  Some commands take other
optional arguments\.  Read the source\.
.P
You cannot set configs individually for any single npm function at this
time\.  Since \fBnpm\fP is a singleton, any call to \fBnpm\.config\.set\fP will
change the value for \fIall\fR npm commands in that process\.
.P
See \fB\|\./bin/npm\-cli\.js\fP for an example of pulling config values off of the
command line arguments using nopt\.  You may also want to check out \fBnpm
help config\fP to learn about all the options you can set there\.
.SH More Docs
.P
Check out the docs \fIhttps://docs\.npmjs\.com/\fR,
especially the faq \fIhttps://docs\.npmjs\.com/misc/faq\fR\|\.
.P
You can use the \fBnpm help\fP command to read any of them\.
.P
If you're a developer, and you want to use npm to publish your program,
you should read this \fIhttps://docs\.npmjs\.com/misc/developers\fR

Be sure to include \fIall\fR of the output from the npm command that didn't work
as expected\.  The \fBnpm\-debug\.log\fP file is also helpful to provide\.
.P
You can also look for isaacs in #node\.js on irc://irc\.freenode\.net\.  He
