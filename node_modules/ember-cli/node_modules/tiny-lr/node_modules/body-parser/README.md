Node.js body parsing middleware.

_This does not handle multipart bodies_, due to their complex and typically
large nature. For multipart bodies, you may be interested in the following
modules:

  * [busboy](https://www.npmjs.org/package/busboy#readme) and
    [connect-busboy](https://www.npmjs.org/package/connect-busboy#readme)
  * [multiparty](https://www.npmjs.org/package/multiparty#readme) and
    [connect-multiparty](https://www.npmjs.org/package/connect-multiparty#readme)
  * [formidable](https://www.npmjs.org/package/formidable#readme)
  * [multer](https://www.npmjs.org/package/multer#readme)

This module provides the following parsers:

  * [JSON body parser](#bodyparserjsonoptions)
  * [Raw body parser](#bodyparserrawoptions)
  * [Text body parser](#bodyparsertextoptions)
  * [URL-encoded form body parser](#bodyparserurlencodedoptions)

Other body parsers you might be interested in:

- [body](https://www.npmjs.org/package/body#readme)
- [co-body](https://www.npmjs.org/package/co-body#readme)

## Installation

```sh
$ npm install body-parser
```

## API

```js
var bodyParser = require('body-parser')
```

The `bodyParser` object exposes various factories to create middlewares. All
middlewares will populate the `req.body` property with the parsed body or
provide an error to the callback. The various errors are described in the
[errors section](#errors).

### bodyParser.json(options)

Returns middleware that only parses `json`. This parser accepts any Unicode
encoding of the body and supports automatic inflation of `gzip` and `deflate`
encodings.

A new `body` object containing the parsed data is populated on the `request`
object after the middleware (i.e. `req.body`).

#### Options

The `json` function takes an option `options` object that may contain any of
the following keys:

##### inflate

When set to `true`, then deflated (compressed) bodies will be inflated; when
`false`, deflated bodies are rejected. Defaults to `true`.

##### limit

Controls the maximum request body size. If this is a number, then the value
specifies the number of bytes; if it is a string, the value is passed to the
[bytes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bytes) library for parsing. Defaults
to `'100kb'`.

##### reviver

The `reviver` option is passed directly to `JSON.parse` as the second
argument. You can find more information on this argument
[in the MDN documentation about JSON.parse](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse#Example.3A_Using_the_reviver_parameter).

##### strict

When set to `true`, will only accept arrays and objects; when `false` will
accept anything `JSON.parse` accepts. Defaults to `true`.

##### type

The `type` option is used to determine what media type the middleware will
parse. This option can be a function or a string. If a string, `type` option
is passed directly to the [type-is](https://www.npmjs.org/package/type-is#readme)
library and this can be an extension name (like `json`), a mime type (like
`application/json`), or a mime type with a wildcard (like `*/*` or `*/json`).
If a function, the `type` option is called as `fn(req)` and the request is
parsed if it returns a truthy value. Defaults to `application/json`.

##### verify

The `verify` option, if supplied, is called as `verify(req, res, buf, encoding)`,
where `buf` is a `Buffer` of the raw request body and `encoding` is the
encoding of the request. The parsing can be aborted by throwing an error.

### bodyParser.raw(options)

Returns middleware that parses all bodies as a `Buffer`. This parser
supports automatic inflation of `gzip` and `deflate` encodings.

A new `body` object containing the parsed data is populated on the `request`
object after the middleware (i.e. `req.body`). This will be a `Buffer` object
of the body.

#### Options

The `raw` function takes an option `options` object that may contain any of
the following keys:

##### inflate

When set to `true`, then deflated (compressed) bodies will be inflated; when
`false`, deflated bodies are rejected. Defaults to `true`.

##### limit

Controls the maximum request body size. If this is a number, then the value
specifies the number of bytes; if it is a string, the value is passed to the
[bytes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bytes) library for parsing. Defaults
to `'100kb'`.

##### type

The `type` option is used to determine what media type the middleware will
parse. This option can be a function or a string. If a string, `type` option
is passed directly to the [type-is](https://www.npmjs.org/package/type-is#readme)
library and this can be an extension name (like `bin`), a mime type (like
`application/octet-stream`), or a mime type with a wildcard (like `*/*` or
`application/*`). If a function, the `type` option is called as `fn(req)`
and the request is parsed if it returns a truthy value. Defaults to
`application/octet-stream`.

##### verify

The `verify` option, if supplied, is called as `verify(req, res, buf, encoding)`,
where `buf` is a `Buffer` of the raw request body and `encoding` is the
encoding of the request. The parsing can be aborted by throwing an error.

### bodyParser.text(options)

Returns middleware that parses all bodies as a string. This parser supports
automatic inflation of `gzip` and `deflate` encodings.

A new `body` string containing the parsed data is populated on the `request`
object after the middleware (i.e. `req.body`). This will be a string of the
body.

#### Options

The `text` function takes an option `options` object that may contain any of
the following keys:

##### defaultCharset

Specify the default character set for the text content if the charset is not
specified in the `Content-Type` header of the request. Defaults to `utf-8`.

##### inflate

When set to `true`, then deflated (compressed) bodies will be inflated; when
`false`, deflated bodies are rejected. Defaults to `true`.

##### limit

Controls the maximum request body size. If this is a number, then the value
specifies the number of bytes; if it is a string, the value is passed to the
[bytes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bytes) library for parsing. Defaults
to `'100kb'`.

##### type

The `type` option is used to determine what media type the middleware will
parse. This option can be a function or a string. If a string, `type` option
is passed directly to the [type-is](https://www.npmjs.org/package/type-is#readme)
library and this can be an extension name (like `txt`), a mime type (like
`text/plain`), or a mime type with a wildcard (like `*/*` or `text/*`).
If a function, the `type` option is called as `fn(req)` and the request is
parsed if it returns a truthy value. Defaults to `text/plain`.

##### verify

The `verify` option, if supplied, is called as `verify(req, res, buf, encoding)`,
where `buf` is a `Buffer` of the raw request body and `encoding` is the
encoding of the request. The parsing can be aborted by throwing an error.

### bodyParser.urlencoded(options)

Returns middleware that only parses `urlencoded` bodies. This parser accepts
only UTF-8 encoding of the body and supports automatic inflation of `gzip`
and `deflate` encodings.

A new `body` object containing the parsed data is populated on the `request`
object after the middleware (i.e. `req.body`). This object will contain
key-value pairs, where the value can be a string or array (when `extended` is
`false`), or any type (when `extended` is `true`).

#### Options

The `urlencoded` function takes an option `options` object that may contain
any of the following keys:

##### extended

The `extended` option allows to choose between parsing the URL-encoded data
with the `querystring` library (when `false`) or the `qs` library (when
`true`). The "extended" syntax allows for rich objects and arrays to be
encoded into the URL-encoded format, allowing for a JSON-like experience
with URL-encoded. For more information, please
[see the qs library](https://www.npmjs.org/package/qs#readme).

Defaults to `true`, but using the default has been deprecated. Please
research into the difference between `qs` and `querystring` and choose the
appropriate setting.

##### inflate

When set to `true`, then deflated (compressed) bodies will be inflated; when
`false`, deflated bodies are rejected. Defaults to `true`.

##### limit

Controls the maximum request body size. If this is a number, then the value
specifies the number of bytes; if it is a string, the value is passed to the
[bytes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bytes) library for parsing. Defaults
to `'100kb'`.

##### parameterLimit

The `parameterLimit` option controls the maximum number of parameters that
are allowed in the URL-encoded data. If a request contains more parameters
than this value, a 413 will be returned to the client. Defaults to `1000`.

##### type

The `type` option is used to determine what media type the middleware will
parse. This option can be a function or a string. If a string, `type` option
is passed directly to the [type-is](https://www.npmjs.org/package/type-is#readme)
library and this can be an extension name (like `urlencoded`), a mime type (like
`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`), or a mime type with a wildcard (like
`*/x-www-form-urlencoded`). If a function, the `type` option is called as
`fn(req)` and the request is parsed if it returns a truthy value. Defaults
to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

##### verify

The `verify` option, if supplied, is called as `verify(req, res, buf, encoding)`,
where `buf` is a `Buffer` of the raw request body and `encoding` is the
encoding of the request. The parsing can be aborted by throwing an error.

## Errors

The middlewares provided by this module create errors depending on the error
condition during parsing. The errors will typically have a `status` property
that contains the suggested HTTP response code.

The following are the common errors emitted, though any error can come through
for various reasons.

### content encoding unsupported

This error will occur when the request had a `Content-Encoding` header that
contained an encoding but the "inflation" option was set to `false`. The
`status` property is set to `415`.

### request aborted

This error will occur when the request is aborted by the client before reading
the body has finished. The `received` property will be set to the number of
bytes received before the request was aborted and the `expected` property is
set to the number of expected bytes. The `status` property is set to `400`.

### request entity too large

This error will occur when the request body's size is larger than the "limit"
option. The `limit` property will be set to the byte limit and the `length`
property will be set to the request body's length. The `status` property is
set to `413`.

### request size did not match content length

This error will occur when the request's length did not match the length from
the `Content-Length` header. This typically occurs when the request is malformed,
typically when the `Content-Length` header was calculated based on characters
instead of bytes. The `status` property is set to `400`.

### stream encoding should not be set

This error will occur when something called the `req.setEncoding` method prior
to this middleware. This module operates directly on bytes only and you cannot
call `req.setEncoding` when using this module. The `status` property is set to
`500`.

### unsupported charset "BOGUS"

This error will occur when the request had a charset parameter in the
`Content-Type` header, but the `iconv-lite` module does not support it OR the
parser does not support it. The charset is contained in the message as well
as in the `charset` property. The `status` property is set to `415`.

### unsupported content encoding "bogus"

This error will occur when the request had a `Content-Encoding` header that
contained an unsupported encoding. The encoding is contained in the message
as well as in the `encoding` property. The `status` property is set to `415`.

## Examples

### express/connect top-level generic

This example demonstrates adding a generic JSON and URL-encoded parser as a
top-level middleware, which will parse the bodies of all incoming requests.
This is the simplest setup.

```js
var express = require('express')
var bodyParser = require('body-parser')

var app = express()

// parse application/x-www-form-urlencoded
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }))

// parse application/json
app.use(bodyParser.json())

app.use(function (req, res) {
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain')
  res.write('you posted:\n')
  res.end(JSON.stringify(req.body, null, 2))
})
```

### express route-specific

This example demonstrates adding body parsers specifically to the routes that
need them. In general, this is the most recommend way to use body-parser with
express.

```js
var express = require('express')
var bodyParser = require('body-parser')

var app = express()

// create application/json parser
var jsonParser = bodyParser.json()

// create application/x-www-form-urlencoded parser
var urlencodedParser = bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false })

// POST /login gets urlencoded bodies
app.post('/login', urlencodedParser, function (req, res) {
  if (!req.body) return res.sendStatus(400)
  res.send('welcome, ' + req.body.username)
})

// POST /api/users gets JSON bodies
app.post('/api/users', jsonParser, function (req, res) {
  if (!req.body) return res.sendStatus(400)
  // create user in req.body
})
```

### change content-type for parsers

All the parsers accept a `type` option which allows you to change the
`Content-Type` that the middleware will parse.

```js
// parse various different custom JSON types as JSON
app.use(bodyParser.json({ type: 'application/*+json' }))

// parse some custom thing into a Buffer
app.use(bodyParser.raw({ type: 'application/vnd.custom-type' }))

// parse an HTML body into a string
app.use(bodyParser.text({ type: 'text/html' }))
```
