/**
 Starting with version 2.0, this file "boots" Jasmine, performing all of the necessary initialization before executing the loaded environment and all of a project's specs. This file should be loaded after `jasmine.js` and `jasmine_html.js`, but before any project source files or spec files are loaded. Thus this file can also be used to customize Jasmine for a project.

 If a project is using Jasmine via the standalone distribution, this file can be customized directly. If a project is using Jasmine via the [Ruby gem][jasmine-gem], this file can be copied into the support directory via `jasmine copy_boot_js`. Other environments (e.g., Python) will have different mechanisms.

 The location of `boot.js` can be specified and/or overridden in `jasmine.yml`.
