  * Fix usage of partial templates.

## [0.8.0] / 2 Dec 2013

## [0.7.3] / 5 Nov 2013

  * Don't require the original template to be passed to the rendering function

  * Handle empty templates gracefully. Fixes [#265], [#267], and [#270].
  * Cache partials by template, not by name. Fixes [#257].
  * Added Mustache.compileTokens to compile the output of Mustache.parse. Fixes
    [#258].

## [0.7.0] / 10 Sep 2012

  * Rename Renderer => Writer.
  * Allow partials to be loaded dynamically using a callback (thanks
    [@TiddoLangerak] for the suggestion).
  * Fixed a bug with higher-order sections that prevented them from being
    passed the raw text of the section from the original template.
  * More concise token format. Tokens also include start/end indices in the
    original template.
  * High-level API is consistent with the Writer API.
  * Allow partials to be passed to the pre-compiled function (thanks
    [@fallenice]).
  * Don't use eval (thanks [@cweider]).

## [0.6.0] / 31 Aug 2012

  * Use JavaScript's definition of falsy when determining whether to render an
    inverted section or not. Issue [#186].
  * Use Mustache.escape to escape values inside {{}}. This function may be
    reassigned to alter the default escaping behavior. Issue [#244].
  * Fixed a bug that clashed with QUnit (thanks [@kannix]).
  * Added volo support (thanks [@guybedford]).
