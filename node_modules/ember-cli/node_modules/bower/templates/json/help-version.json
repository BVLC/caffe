In the second case, the existing version will be incremented\nby 1 in the specified field.\n\nIf run in a git repo, it will also create a version commit and tag, and fail if the repo is not clean.\n\nIf supplied with --message (shorthand: -m) config option, bower will use it as a commit message when creating a version commit. If the message config contains %s then that will be replaced with the resulting\nversion number. For example:\n\n    bower version patch -m \"Upgrade to %s for reasons\"",
