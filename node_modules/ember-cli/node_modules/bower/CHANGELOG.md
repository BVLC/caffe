- Ignore symlinks when copying/extracting since they are not portable, specially across different hard-drives ([#665](https://github.com/bower/bower/issues/665))
- Local file/dir endpoints are now exclusively referenced by an absolute path or relative path starting with `.` ([#666](https://github.com/bower/bower/issues/666))

- `bower install` no longer overwrites `linked` packages unless it needs to ([#593](https://github.com/bower/bower/issues/593)).
- All endpoint parts are now trimmed so that the Manager can better detect similar endpoints ([#3@endpoint-parser](https://github.com/bower/endpoint-parser/pull/3))
- `bower register` now shows the server that will be used ([#647](https://github.com/bower/endpoint-parser/pull/647))


## 1.0.0 - 2013-07-23

Total rewrite of bower.
The list bellow highlights the most important stuff.
For a complete list of changes that this rewrite and release brings please read: https://github.com/bower/bower/wiki/Rewrite-state


- Clear architecture and separation of concerns
- Much much faster
- `--json` output for all commands
- `--offline` usage for all commands, except `register`
- Proper `install` and `update` commands, similar to `npm` in behaviour
- Named endpoints when installing, e.g. `bower install backbone-amd=backbone#~1.0.0`
- New interactive conflict resolution strategy
- Prevent human errors when using `register`
- New `home` command, similar to `npm`
- New `cache list` command
- New `prune` command
- Many many general bug fixes

Non-backwards compatible changes:

- The value of the `json` property from .bowerrc is no longer used
- `--map` and `--sources` from the list command were removed, use `--json` instead
- Programmatic usage changed, specially the commands interface

Users upgrading from `bower-canary` and `bower@~0.x.x` should do a `bower cache clean`.
Additionally you may remove the `~/.bower` folder manually since it's no longer used.
On Windows the folder is located in `AppData/bower`.
