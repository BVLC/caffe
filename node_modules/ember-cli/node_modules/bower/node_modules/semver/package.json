  "readme": "semver(1) -- The semantic versioner for npm\n===========================================\n\n## Usage\n\n    $ npm install semver\n\n    semver.valid('1.2.3') // '1.2.3'\n    semver.valid('a.b.c') // null\n    semver.clean('  =v1.2.3   ') // '1.2.3'\n    semver.satisfies('1.2.3', '1.x || >=2.5.0 || 5.0.0 - 7.2.3') // true\n    semver.gt('1.2.3', '9.8.7') // false\n    semver.lt('1.2.3', '9.8.7') // true\n\nAs a command-line utility:\n\n    $ semver -h\n\n    Usage: semver <version> [<version> [...]] [-r <range> | -i <inc> | -d <dec>]\n    Test if version(s) satisfy the supplied range(s), and sort them.\n\n    Multiple versions or ranges may be supplied, unless increment\n    or decrement options are specified.  In that case, only a single\n    version may be used, and it is incremented by the specified level\n\n    Program exits successfully if any valid version satisfies\n    all supplied ranges, and prints all satisfying versions.\n\n    If no versions are valid, or ranges are not satisfied,\n    then exits failure.\n\n    Versions are printed in ascending order, so supplying\n    multiple versions to the utility will just sort them.\n\n## Versions\n\nA \"version\" is described by the `v2.0.0` specification found at\n<http://semver.org/>.\n\nA leading `\"=\"` or `\"v\"` character is stripped off and ignored.\n\n## Ranges\n\nThe following range styles are supported:\n\n* `1.2.3` A specific version.  When nothing else will do.  Must be a full\n  version number, with major, minor, and patch versions specified.\n  Note that build metadata is still ignored, so `1.2.3+build2012` will\n  satisfy this range.\n* `>1.2.3` Greater than a specific version.\n* `<1.2.3` Less than a specific version.  If there is no prerelease\n  tag on the version range, then no prerelease version will be allowed\n  either, even though these are technically \"less than\".\n* `>=1.2.3` Greater than or equal to.  Note that prerelease versions\n  are NOT equal to their \"normal\" equivalents, so `1.2.3-beta` will\n  not satisfy this range, but `2.3.0-beta` will.\n* `<=1.2.3` Less than or equal to.  In this case, prerelease versions\n  ARE allowed, so `1.2.3-beta` would satisfy.\n* `1.2.3 - 2.3.4` := `>=1.2.3 <=2.3.4`\n* `~1.2.3` := `>=1.2.3-0 <1.3.0-0`  \"Reasonably close to `1.2.3`\".  When\n  using tilde operators, prerelease versions are supported as well,\n  but a prerelease of the next significant digit will NOT be\n  satisfactory, so `1.3.0-beta` will not satisfy `~1.2.3`.\n* `^1.2.3` := `>=1.2.3-0 <2.0.0-0`  \"Compatible with `1.2.3`\".  When\n  using caret operators, anything from the specified version (including\n  prerelease) will be supported up to, but not including, the next\n  major version (or its prereleases). `1.5.1` will satisfy `^1.2.3`,\n  while `1.2.2` and `2.0.0-beta` will not.\n* `^0.1.3` := `>=0.1.3-0 <0.2.0-0` \"Compatible with `0.1.3`\". `0.x.x` versions are\n  special: the first non-zero component indicates potentially breaking changes,\n  meaning the caret operator matches any version with the same first non-zero\n  component starting at the specified version.\n* `^0.0.2` := `=0.0.2` \"Only the version `0.0.2` is considered compatible\"\n* `~1.2` := `>=1.2.0-0 <1.3.0-0` \"Any version starting with `1.2`\"\n* `^1.2` := `>=1.2.0-0 <2.0.0-0` \"Any version compatible with `1.2`\"\n* `1.2.x` := `>=1.2.0-0 <1.3.0-0` \"Any version starting with `1.2`\"\n* `1.2.*` Same as `1.2.x`.\n* `1.2` Same as `1.2.x`.\n* `~1` := `>=1.0.0-0 <2.0.0-0` \"Any version starting with `1`\"\n* `^1` := `>=1.0.0-0 <2.0.0-0` \"Any version compatible with `1`\"\n* `1.x` := `>=1.0.0-0 <2.0.0-0` \"Any version starting with `1`\"\n* `1.*` Same as `1.x`.\n* `1` Same as `1.x`.\n* `*` Any version whatsoever.\n* `x` Same as `*`.\n* `\"\"` (just an empty string) Same as `*`.\n\n\nRanges can be joined with either a space (which implies \"and\") or a\n`||` (which implies \"or\").\n\n## Functions\n\nAll methods and classes take a final `loose` boolean argument that, if\ntrue, will be more forgiving about not-quite-valid semver strings.\nThe resulting output will always be 100% strict, of course.\n\nStrict-mode Comparators and Ranges will be strict about the SemVer\nstrings that they parse.\n\n* `valid(v)`: Return the parsed version, or null if it's not valid.\n* `inc(v, release)`: Return the version incremented by the release\n  type (`major`,   `premajor`, `minor`, `preminor`, `patch`,\n  `prepatch`, or `prerelease`), or null if it's not valid\n  * `premajor` in one call will bump the version up to the next major\n    version and down to a prerelease of that major version.\n    `preminor`, and `prepatch` work the same way.\n  * If called from a non-prerelease version, the `prerelease` will work the\n    same as `prepatch`. It increments the patch version, then makes a\n    prerelease. If the input version is already a prerelease it simply\n    increments it.\n\n### Comparison\n\n* `gt(v1, v2)`: `v1 > v2`\n* `gte(v1, v2)`: `v1 >= v2`\n* `lt(v1, v2)`: `v1 < v2`\n* `lte(v1, v2)`: `v1 <= v2`\n* `eq(v1, v2)`: `v1 == v2` This is true if they're logically equivalent,\n  even if they're not the exact same string.  You already know how to\n  compare strings.\n* `neq(v1, v2)`: `v1 != v2` The opposite of `eq`.\n* `cmp(v1, comparator, v2)`: Pass in a comparison string, and it'll call\n  the corresponding function above.  `\"===\"` and `\"!==\"` do simple\n  string comparison, but are included for completeness.  Throws if an\n  invalid comparison string is provided.\n* `compare(v1, v2)`: Return `0` if `v1 == v2`, or `1` if `v1` is greater, or `-1` if\n  `v2` is greater.  Sorts in ascending order if passed to `Array.sort()`.\n* `rcompare(v1, v2)`: The reverse of compare.  Sorts an array of versions\n  in descending order when passed to `Array.sort()`.\n\n\n### Ranges\n\n* `validRange(range)`: Return the valid range or null if it's not valid\n* `satisfies(version, range)`: Return true if the version satisfies the\n  range.\n* `maxSatisfying(versions, range)`: Return the highest version in the list\n  that satisfies the range, or `null` if none of them do.\n* `gtr(version, range)`: Return `true` if version is greater than all the\n  versions possible in the range.\n* `ltr(version, range)`: Return `true` if version is less than all the\n  versions possible in the range.\n* `outside(version, range, hilo)`: Return true if the version is outside\n  the bounds of the range in either the high or low direction.  The\n  `hilo` argument must be either the string `'>'` or `'<'`.  (This is\n  the function called by `gtr` and `ltr`.)\n\nNote that, since ranges may be non-contiguous, a version might not be\ngreater than a range, less than a range, *or* satisfy a range!  For\nexample, the range `1.2 <1.2.9 || >2.0.0` would have a hole from `1.2.9`\nuntil `2.0.0`, so the version `1.2.10` would not be greater than the\nrange (because `2.0.1` satisfies, which is higher), nor less than the\nrange (since `1.2.8` satisfies, which is lower), and it also does not\nsatisfy the range.\n\nIf you want to know if a version satisfies or does not satisfy a\nrange, use the `satisfies(version, range)` function.\n",
