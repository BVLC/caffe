## Stable

A stable array sort, because `Array#sort()` is not guaranteed stable.

#### From the browser

Include [`stable.js`] or the minified version [`stable.min.js`]
in your page, then call `stable()`.

#### From Node.js

Install using NPM:

    npm install stable

Require in your code:

    var stable = require("stable");

#### Usage

The default sort is, as with `Array#sort`, lexicographical:

    stable(["foo", "bar", "baz"]);   // => ["bar", "baz", "foo"]
    stable([10, 1, 5]);              // => [1, 10, 5]

Unlike `Array#sort`, the default sort is **NOT** in-place. To do an in-place
sort, use `stable.inplace`, which otherwise works the same:

    var arr = [10, 1, 5];
    stable(arr) === arr;            // => false
    stable.inplace(arr) === arr;    // => true

A comparator function can be specified:

    // Regular sort() compatible comparator, that returns a number.
    // This demonstrates the default behavior.
    function lexCmp(a, b) {
        return String(a).localeCompare(b);
    }
    stable(["foo", "bar", "baz"], lexCmp);   // => ["bar", "baz", "foo"]

    // Boolean comparator. Sorts `b` before `a` if true.
    // This demonstrates a simple way to sort numerically.
    function greaterThan(a, b) {
        return a > b;
    }
    stable([10, 1, 5], greaterThan);  // -> [1, 5, 10]
