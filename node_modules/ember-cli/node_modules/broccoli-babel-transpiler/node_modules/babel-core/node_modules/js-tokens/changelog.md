### Version 1.0.1 (2015-06-20) ###

- Fixed: Declared an undeclared variable.


### Version 1.0.0 (2015-02-26) ###

- Changed: Merged the 'operator' and 'punctuation' types into 'punctuator'. That
  type is now equivalent to the Punctuator token in the ECMAScript
  specification. (Backwards-incompatible change.)
- Fixed: A `-` followed by a number is now correctly matched as a punctuator
  followed by a number. It used to be matched as just a number, but there is no
  such thing as negative number literals. (Possibly backwards-incompatible
  change.)


### Version 0.4.1 (2015-02-21) ###

- Added: Support for the regex `u` flag.


### Version 0.4.0 (2015-02-21) ###

- Improved: `jsTokens.matchToToken` performance.
- Added: Support for octal and binary number literals.
- Added: Support for template strings.


### Version 0.3.1 (2015-01-06) ###

- Fixed: Support for unicode spaces. They used to be allowed in names (which is
  very confusing), and some unicode newlines were wrongly allowed in strings and
  regexes.


### Version 0.3.0 (2014-12-19) ###

- Changed: The `jsTokens.names` array has been replaced with the
  `jsTokens.matchToToken` function. The capturing groups of `jsTokens` are no
  longer part of the public API; instead use said function. See this [gist] for
  an example. (Backwards-incompatible change.)
- Changed: The empty string is now considered an “invalid” token, instead an
  “empty” token (its own group). (Backwards-incompatible change.)
- Removed: component support. (Backwards-incompatible change.)

### Version 0.2.0 (2014-06-19) ###

- Changed: Match ES6 function arrows (`=>`) as an operator, instead of its own
  category (“functionArrow”), for simplicity. (Backwards-incompatible change.)
- Added: ES6 splats (`...`) are now matched as an operator (instead of three
  punctuations). (Backwards-incompatible change.)


### Version 0.1.0 (2014-03-08) ###

- Initial release.
