# send

  Send is Connect's `static()` extracted for generalized use, a streaming static file
  server supporting partial responses (Ranges), conditional-GET negotiation, high test coverage, and granular events which may be leveraged to take appropriate actions in your application or framework.

## Installation

    $ npm install send

## Examples

  Small:

```js
var http = require('http');
var send = require('send');

var app = http.createServer(function(req, res){
  send(req, req.url).pipe(res);
});
```

  Serving from a root directory with custom error-handling:

```js
var http = require('http');
var send = require('send');

var app = http.createServer(function(req, res){
  // your custom error-handling logic:
  function error(err) {
    res.statusCode = err.status || 500;
    res.end(err.message);
  }

  // your custom directory handling logic:
  function redirect() {
    res.statusCode = 301;
    res.setHeader('Location', req.url + '/');
    res.end('Redirecting to ' + req.url + '/');
  }

  // transfer arbitrary files from within
  // /www/example.com/public/*
  send(req, url.parse(req.url).pathname)
  .root('/www/example.com/public')
  .on('error', error)
  .on('directory', redirect)
  .pipe(res);
});
```

## API

### Events

  - `error` an error occurred `(err)`
  - `directory` a directory was requested
  - `stream` file streaming has started `(stream)`
  - `end` streaming has completed

### .root(dir)

  Serve files relative to `path`. Aliased as `.from(dir)`.

### .index(path)

  By default send supports "index.html" files, to disable this
  invoke `.index(false)` or to supply a new index pass a string.

### .maxage(ms)

  Provide a max-age in milliseconds for http caching, defaults to 0.

## Error-handling

  By default when no `error` listeners are present an automatic response will be made, otherwise you have full control over the response, aka you may show a 5xx page etc.

## Caching

  It does _not_ perform internal caching, you should use a reverse proxy cache such
  as Varnish for this, or those fancy things called CDNs. If your application is small enough that it would benefit from single-node memory caching, it's small enough that it does not need caching at all ;).

## Debugging

 To enable `debug()` instrumentation output export __DEBUG__:

```
$ DEBUG=send node app
```

## Running tests

```
$ npm install
$ make test
```
