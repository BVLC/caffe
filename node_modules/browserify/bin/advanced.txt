Advanced Options:

  --insert-globals, --ig, --fast    [default: false]

    Skip detection and always insert definitions for process, global,
    __filename, and __dirname.
                  
    benefit: faster builds
    cost: extra bytes
 
  --insert-global-vars, --igv

    Comma-separated list of global variables to detect and define.
    Default: __filename,__dirname,process,Buffer,global
 
  --detect-globals, --dg            [default: true]

    Detect the presence of process, global, __filename, and __dirname and define
    these values when present.

    benefit: npm modules more likely to work
    cost: slower builds

  --ignore-missing, --im            [default: false]

    Ignore `require()` statements that don't resolve to anything.

  --noparse=FILE

    Don't parse FILE at all. This will make bundling much, much faster for giant
    libs like jquery or threejs.

  --no-builtins

    Turn off builtins. This is handy when you want to run a bundle in node which
    provides the core builtins.

  --no-commondir
 
    Turn off setting a commondir. This is useful if you want to preserve the
    original paths that a bundle was generated with. 
 
  --no-bundle-external

    Turn off bundling of all external modules. This is useful if you only want
    to bundle your local files.

  --bare 

    Alias for both --no-builtins, --no-commondir, and sets --insert-global-vars
    to just "__filename,__dirname". This is handy if you want to run bundles in
    node.

  --no-browser-field, --no-bf

    Turn off package.json browser field resolution. This is also handy if you
    need to run a bundle in node.

  --node

    Alias for --bare and --no-browser-field.

  --full-paths

    Turn off converting module ids into numerical indexes. This is useful for
    preserving the original paths that a bundle was generated with.

  --deps
  
    Instead of standard bundle output, print the dependency array generated by
    module-deps.

  --list
 
    Print each file in the dependency graph. Useful for makefiles.

  --extension=EXTENSION

    Consider files with specified EXTENSION as modules, this option can used
    multiple times.

  --global-transform=MODULE, -g MODULE

    Use a transform module on all files after any ordinary transforms have run.

  --plugin=MODULE, -p MODULE

    Register MODULE as a plugin.

Passing arguments to transforms and plugins:

  For -t, -g, and -p, you may use subarg syntax to pass options to the
  transforms or plugin function as the second parameter. For example:

    -t [ foo -x 3 --beep ]

  will call the `foo` transform for each applicable file by calling:

    foo(file, { x: 3, beep: true })
